Capo 5
[Intro] Am  C  G  C ; F  C  F

[Verse]
Am              C        G           C
Pour the petrol can, around this caravan.
     F        C                   F
And watch the flames take all you own.
          Am             C             G               C
There's a girl who understands, by the back of her two hands.
F               C       F
  She's all you need to know.

[Chorus]
           G                        C         G         F
'Cause you search for years but you lose everything you find.
        G                        C   G             F
There's braille for the deaf and signposts for the blind.
        G                            C     G             F
There's heaven for the cruel but the devil waits for the kind.

(Whistling) Am  C  G  C ; F  C  F

[Verse]
        Am                   C                 G             C
And you follow the blackbird home, through the early winter snow.
F                  C                     F
   Your footprints track you through the grass.
        Am                      C               G                   C
And you ache just to smell her clothes, and her cooking down on the stove.
F              C                    F
   You see her face in everyone you pass.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
G        C         G      F
 And you walk down to her window.
G               C    G            F
 And press your face against the glass.
G        C          G      F
 Only to find that she is happy in his arms.

(Whistling) Am  C  G  C ; F  C  F

[Chorus]
