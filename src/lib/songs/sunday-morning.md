[Intro] Dm7 - G7 - C  x2

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you


[Chorus]  Dm7  G7  C
That may be all I   need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with  me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave


[Verse 2] Dm7  G7  C
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends

[Chorus]  Dm7  G7  C
That may be all I   need
In darkness she is all I   see
Come and rest your bones with  me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Bridge]
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

[Chorus]  Dm7  G7  C
That may be all I   need
In darkness she is all I   see
Come and rest your bones with  me
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
yeah, yeah

ah yea yeah x5
