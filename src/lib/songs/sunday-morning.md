[Intro] Dm7 - G7 - C  x2

[Verse 1]
Dm7           G7            C
   Sunday morning rain is falling
Dm7             G7           C
   Steal some covers share some skin
Dm7           G7               C
   Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
       Dm7               G7           C
   You twist to fit the mold that I am in
        Dm7                 G7           C
   But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
               Dm7            G7              C
   And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
        Dm7               G7             C
   That someday it would lead me back to you
        Dm7               G7             C
   That someday it would lead me back to you


[Chorus]
            Dm7 G7  C
That may be all I   need
                   Dm7 G7  C
In darkness she is all I   see
                   Dm7    G7   C
Come and rest your bones with  me
                       Dm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
       G7            C
And I never want to leave


[Verse 2]
Dm7         G7               C
   Fingers trace your every outline
Dm7         G7           C
   Paint a picture with my hands
Dm7          G7                C
   Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
              Dm7               G7           C
   Change the weather still together when it ends








[Chorus]
            Dm7 G7  C
That may be all I   need
                   Dm7 G7  C
In darkness she is all I   see
                   Dm7    G7   C
Come and rest your bones with  me
                       Dm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      G7            C
And I never want to leave

     Dm7                 G7           C
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
            Dm7            G7              C
