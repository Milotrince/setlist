 You've got a friend in me,   You've got a friend in me

 When the road looks rough ahead

And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed

You just remember what your old pal said

Boy, you've got a friend in me

You got troubles, I got them too

 There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you

 Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am 
C           B7       C
 Bigger and stronger too, maybe ...
B                      B7
 But none of them will ever love you 
    Em    A7       Dm     G
The way I do, It's me and you, boy

 You're gonna see it's our des-ti-ny
