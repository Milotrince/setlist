[Intro] G Gsus4 G

[Verse 1]
G               Am   D     D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C                 Am           G        Gsus4  G
Just like the ones I used to know.
 G              G             G7
Where the tree tops glisten,
      C              Cm
And children listen,
  G              Em             Am      D   D7
To hear the sleigh bells in the snow.

[Verse 2]
G                    Am   D     D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C            Am             G      Gsus4  G
With every Christmas card I write.
         G        G7        C     Cm
May your days be merry and bright,
      G    Em    Am      D       G
And may all your Christmases be white.

[Verse 3]
G               Am   D     D7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
C                 Am           G        Gsus4  G
Just like the ones I used to know.
G               G             G7
Where the tree tops glisten,
      C              Cm
And children listen,
  G              Em             Am      D   D7
To hear the sleigh bells in the snow.

[Verse 4]

With every Christmas card I write.

May your dreams be merry and bright,
     G      Em    Am     D       G    Gsus4 G
And may all your Christmases be white.
