Capo 7
[Intro] Am Dm C ; G C C/B ; Am Dm C ; G Gadd4 G

[Verse 1]
       Am                           Fmaj7
Well, grey clouds wrapped round the town like elastic
 G                            C         C/B
Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
C/B   x22010
Em7   020030
Gadd4 320013
Fmaj7 103210 
C7    030010  

    Am                          Fmaj7                G    Gadd4  G
The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain
       Am                               Fmaj7
While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heels rub toes
 G                          C        C/B
Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
  Am                             Fmaj7                         G    Gadd4  G
Dressed in their suits and their boots, well they all look the same

[Bridge 1]
   F                       G
I took myself down to the cafe to find all
    C            C/B         Am      G
the boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
     F                 G                     C    C7
And carved out a poem above the urinal that read

[Chorus]
            F                G
Don't you cry for the lost, smile for the living
 C           C/B           Am                G
Get what you need and give what you're given
 F                        G
Life's for the living so live it
                      Am
Or you're better off dead

[Instrumental] Am Dm C ; G C C/B ; Am Dm C ; G Gadd4 G

[Verse 2]
          Am                      Fmaj7
While the evening pulled the moon out of its packet
  G                            C          C/B
Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
    Am                   Fmaj7                          G   Gadd4  G
We needed a nail but we tacked it till it fell off the wall
       Am                      Fmaj7
While pigeons pecked drains, sparks flew like planes
     G                              C       C/B
The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
       Am                       Fmaj7                G   Gadd4  G
And we all had new iPhones but no one had no one to call


[Bridge 2]
    F                       G
And I stumbled down to the stomach of the town
           C           C/B           Am        G
Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
        F                     G                   C    C7
With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said

[Chorus]

[Instrumental] Am Dm C ; G C C/B ; Am Dm C ; G Gadd4 G

[Verse 3]
           Am                       Fmaj7
Well, I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage
      G                          C             C/B
They take your dreams down and stick them in storage
         Am                             Fmaj7                      G    Gadd4  G
You can have them back son when you've paid off your mortgage and loans
       Am                        Fmaj7
Yeah, hell with this place, I'll go it my own way
       G                        C             C/B
I'll stick out my thumb and I trudge down the highway
 Am                     Fmaj7         G    Gadd4  G
Someday someone must be going my way home

[Bridge 3]
          F                        G
Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car
        C           C/B           Am             G
With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars
           F                       G                         C    C7
And I'll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread

[Chorus]

[Outro]
            F
Don't you cry for the lost
  G
Smile for the living
 C           C/B           Am                G
Get what you need and give what you're given
           F                         G
You know, life is for the living so live it
N.C.
Or you're better off dead
