[Intro]
 G                              Am   C7                  C
First thing that I spotted was that freckle on your cheek
 G                              G7      C7
Those dark eyes were laughing, yea you swallowed me complete
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
Am               Bm
Oh dear there's something that's about you
Am               D
So dear there's nothing else to know
 
 
[Chorus]
G
You've heard every line
Bm
I won't waste your precious time
C/G               D
All I need to know is
 
How do you take your coffee baby
G                 Em
No sense in prying about my zodiac sign
C                         D
I might not take things slow but
                         G
Come on honey can you blame me
 
Em C D
 
 
[Verse 2]
 G                           Am G         C     C7       C
First things first I'll have to make you notice I exist
G                    Am  G      C
Much as I would love to skip ahead to our first kiss
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
Am              Bm
Oh dear there's something that's about you
Am              D
So dear there's nothing else to know
 
 
[Chorus]
G                    E
Someone else might care about your current affairs
C              D
All I need to know
                              G
How do you take your coffee baby
           E                          C
I lose my mind when I imagine you're mine
                          D
I might not take things slow but
                        G
Come on honey can you blame me
 
E7 C D G
E7 C D Am
 
[Pre Chorus]
             G
Oh dear I'm not messin around here
Am         D            D7
So if you want me just say so
 
 
[Chorus]
G                   E   E7                       E   C
You've heard every line I won't waste your precious time
                D
All I need to know is
                             G
How do you take your coffee baby
             E7            E       C
So you're unsure about my alma mater
                D                             G
Soon as we get home I'll show you my diploma maybe
               E                                 C
We're flying blind, I think we'll both be just fine
            D
Worst scenario
                          G
We'll be completely incompatible
