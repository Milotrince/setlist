[Intro]
 D  A  Bm  G

[Verse 1] D A Bm G
I don't wanna die or fade away
I just wanna be someone
I just wanna be someone
Dive and disappear without a trace
I just wanna be someone
Well, doesn't everyone?

And if you feel the great dividing
I wanna be the one you're guiding
Cause I believe that you could lead the way

[Pre-Chorus] (Single Strum) D A Bm G
I just wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I wanna be somebody to someone, oh
I never had nobody and no road home
I wanna be somebody to someone

[Chorus] D A Bm G
And if the sun's upset and the sky goes cold
Then if the clouds get heavy and start to fall
I really need somebody to call my own
I wanna be somebody to someone

Someone to you x4

[Verse 2] D A Bm G
I don't even need to change the world
I'll make the moon shine just for your view
I'll make the starlight circle the room

And if you feel like night is falling
I wanna be the one you're calling
Cause I believe that you could lead the way

[Pre-Chorus] D A Bm G
[Chorus] D A Bm G

[Bridge] D A Bm G
The kingdom come, the rise, the fall
The setting sun above it all
I just wanna be somebody to you

[Pre-Chorus] D A Bm G
[Chorus] D A Bm G
