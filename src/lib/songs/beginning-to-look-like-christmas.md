[Verse 1]
        D                 G         D         D     F#       G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Everywhere you go;
        Em                  A7      D            Bm
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
       A               E           A7
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

[Verse 2]
       D                  G          D       D     F#       G 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in every store,
          Em               A7          D             B
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
        Em/B A     D
On your own  front door.

[Bridge]
           F#                                              Bm       F#        Bm
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots, is the wish of Barney and Ben
 E                                                   A       E7         A7
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk, is the hope of Janice and Jen;
     A
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

[Verse 3]
       D                  G          D        D     F#      G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Everywhere you go
           Em                A7     D                  Bm
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
      A                E               A7
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

[Verse 4]
        D                 G           D       D        F#         G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Soon the bells will start
         Em                        A7          D              B
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
          Em/B A     D
Right within   your heart.

[Outro]
       D                  G          D         D       F#    G
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in every store,
          Em               A7          D             B
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
        Em/B A     F#     B
On your own  front door.
             Em       A    D
Sure it's Christmas once more.
