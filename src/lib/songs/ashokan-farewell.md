[Verse 1]
D                  D7         G           Em
The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan.
    D             Bm            G            A
The pines and the willows know soon we will part.
          D              D7      G          Em
There’s a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken,
       D             Bm        A7          D
And a love that will always remain in my heart.

   D               D7          G             D
My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter,
    D        Bm        A7
The magic of moving as one,
      D            D7     G         D
And a time we’ll remember long ever after
    D             Bm         A7           D
The moonlight and music and dancing are done.

[Verse 2]
        D                   D7             G                Em
Will we climb the hill once more?  Will we walk the woods together?
       D        Bm          G           A
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
     D     D7        G          Em
Will every song stay with us forever?
         D           Bm            A7          D
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

D         D7       G             D
Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
         Bm             A7
Over the lake the stars shine.
     D         D7      G         D
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
    D          Bm         A7            D
The magic and music, or leave them behind.
