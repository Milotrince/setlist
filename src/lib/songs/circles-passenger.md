Capo 9
 
[Intro]
Am7 G Am7 G Am7 G Em D
Am7 G Am7 G Am7 G Em D
 
 
[Verse]
Am7            G
    it's been years
         Am7             G
since we     carved our names
     Am7             G
on a     clocktower door
       Em           D
before everything changed
 
        Am7           G
we were     big eyed boys
         Am7               G
with the     salt on our skin
         Am7            G            A7
and we'd     throw our kites to the wind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em     G      C  C/B Am7
and they'd fly on and on and on and on
Em        G      C  C/B Am7
   on and on and on and on
Em        G      C  C/B Am7...
   on and on and on and on
 
 
... G Am7 G Am7 G Em D
Am7 G Am7 G Am7 G Em D
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am7            G
    it's been years
         Am7            G
since we     whispered soft
         Am7             G
with the     torch light on
        Em        D
and the big light off
 
        Am7        G
we were     tired boys
         Am7              G
with the     soap on our skin
         Am7         G           A7
and we'd     fall asleep to the wind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em     G      C  C/B Am7
and we'd dream on and on and on and on
Em        G      C  C/B Am7
   on and on and on and on
Em        G      C  C/B Am7
   on and on and on and on
 
 
 
[Verse]
 
           G
cos we're circles
       Bm7        Am7
we're circles you see
       G               Bm7
we go round round the sun
       C    C/B      Am7
in and out like the sea
      G            B7
i'll circle round you
          Em           C
you will circle round me
 
 
Am7 G Am7 G Am7 G Em D
 
 
[Outro]
 
Am7         G
    and in years
         Am7              G
when the     torch light thins
        Am7                G
and the     clock tower's gone
        Em         D
and the big light dims
 
         Am7            G
we'll no     longer be boys
           Am7               G
we'll have     lines on our skin
            Am7            G               A7
and they'll     throw our dust to the wind
