[Intro]
Am7 F x2
 
[Verse]
Am7
I feel like I’m losing hope
F
In my body and my soul
        C                G       E7
And the sky, it looks so ominous
Am7
And as time comes to a halt
F
Silence starts to overflow
   C               G
My cries are inconspicuous
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Am7  G       C         F
Tell me, God, are you punishing me?
   Dm                 G             C
Is this the price I’m paying for my past mistakes?
Am7  G     C          F
This is my redemption song
  G#                            G
I need you more than ever right now
        Esus    E7
Can you hear me now?
 
[Chorus]
       Am7
‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud
  F
Even if our words seem meaningless
              C                          G       E7
It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world
  Am7
I wish that someway, somehow
     F
That I can save everyone of us
        C                             G
But the truth is that I’m only one girl
 
[Bridge]
           Am7            G              F             G
Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life
        Am
Come to life…
 
[Verse]
Am7
After all I've had to face
F
Signs of life all washed away
       C                  G       E7
I can still, still feel a gentle breeze
Am7
But no matter how hard I prayed
F
Signs of war have still remained
    C            G
And life, has become my enemy
 
[Chorus]
N.C.
‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud
 
Even if our words seem meaningless
 
It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world
 
I wish that someway, somehow
 
That I can save everyone of us
 
But the truth is that I’m only one girl
G
       Am7
‘Cause we’re gonna shout it loud
  F
Even if our words seem meaningless
              C                          G       E7
It’s like I’m carrying the weight of the world
  Am7
I wish that someway, somehow
     F
That I can save everyone of us
        C                             G
But the truth is that I’m only one girl
 
[Outro]
           Am7            G              F             G
Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life
        Am
Come to life…
