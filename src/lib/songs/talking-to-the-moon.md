[Verse 1]
 
C
  I know you're somewhere out there
E7
Somewhere far away
  Am           G
I want you back
  F
I want you back
 
C
  My neighbors think I'm crazy
    E7
But they don't understand
       Am        G
You're all I had
       F
You're all I had
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm                      G
   At night when the stars
               Dm
light up my room
            G
I sit by myself
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F G Am
Talking to the moon
              F G Am
Tryna get to you
   F                    G         C       G/B   Am
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
   G      F              G
Or am I a fool who sits alone
                Am  G
Talking to the moon
     D
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
  I'm feelin' like I'm famous
    E7
The talk of the town
         Am           G
They say I've gone mad
      F
Yeah, I've gone mad
 
C
  But they don't know what I know
      E7
Cause when the sun goes down
          Am           G
Someone's talkin' back
              F
Yeah, they're talkin' back, ohhh
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm                      G
   At night when the stars
               Dm
light up my room
            G
I sit by myself
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F G Am
Talking to the moon
              F G Am
Tryna get to you
   F                    G         C       G/B   Am
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
   G      F              G
Or am I a fool who sits alone
 
Talking to the moon

   F                    G         C       G/B   Am
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
   G      F              G                     Am   G    D
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?     Ohoooo...
