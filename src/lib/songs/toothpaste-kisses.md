[Intro]

G F# Bm Bm E E

[Verse 1]
A          C#m7
Cradle me, I'll cradle you
A                    C#m7
I'll win your heart, with a whoop-a-woo
D7                           G    F#
Pulling shapes just for your eyes,
        Bm                     E
so with toothpaste kisses and lines

I'll be yours and you'll be

[Verse 2]
A            C#m7
Lay with me, I'll lay with you
A                   C#m7
We'll do the things that lovers do
D7                   G    F#
Put the stars in our eyes,
Bm                                E
and with heart shaped bruises and late night kisses divine
