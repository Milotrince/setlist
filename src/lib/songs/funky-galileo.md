[Verse 1]
Cm                       F7
   Pour another glass of wine
                       Bb   Ab
   Baby, I could die tonight
   G7          Gb7 Cm
   Dancing 'til I  fall
                       F7
   Everybody tells me "Son,
                          Bb  Ab
   We don't move around the sun"
   G7              Gb7  Cm
   Well, I'll show them all


[Chorus]
        F7               Bb
Watch me move, cross the room
Ab   G7  Gb7 Cm           F7
Like I'm cra-zy, they all say
      Bb D  Gm  F        Eb   F
Funky Ga-li-leo got that fe - ver

[Verse 2]
Cm                   F7
   Looking up at the sky
                         Bb Ab
   Don't you ever wonder why
   G7           Gb7 Cm
   We were meant to be?
                           F7
   All the ladies tell me "Dude,
                          Bb  Ab
   lemme see you walk the moon"
   G7          Gb7 Cm
   Someone hold my drink


[Chorus]
         F7              Bb
Watch me slide, run and hide
Ab   G7  Gb7 Cm           F7
Like I'm cra-zy, they all say
      Bb D  Gm  F        Cm   F7
Funky Ga-li-leo got that fe - ver
   Bb  Ab G7
Oh no, oh no

I got that fe - ver
   Bb  Ab G7          Gb7
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
                            Dbm7 Cm7
   And I've been feeling so pent up
Dm7                   Dbm7 Cm7
   Like an ocean in a bath-tub
Dm7                  Dbm7 Cm7
   Nobody seems to un-der—stand
Dm7                       Dbm7 Cm7
   They're calling me an e—vil—man
Dm7                   Dbm7 Cm7
   When all I wanna do is  dance


[Chorus]
         F7              Bb
Watch me slide, run and hide
Ab   G7  Gb7 Cm           F7
Like I'm cra-zy, they all say
      Bb D  Gm  F        Cm   F7
Funky Ga-li-leo got that fe - ver
   Bb  Ab G7
Oh no, oh no
      Gb7  Cm   F7
I got that fe - ver
   Bb  Ab G7          Gb7
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no
Cm   F7
Fe - ver
   Bb  Ab G7
Oh no, oh no
      Gb7  Cm   F7
I got that fe - ver
   Bb     Ab G7 Gb7
Oh no, no
