[Intro] G Em C D

[Verse 1]
G                                          D7
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the Christmas party hop.
Am7        D7         Am7     D7         Am7    D7       G
 Mistletoe hung where you can see; every couple wants to stop.

[Verse 2]
G                                           D7
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree; let the Christmas spirit ring.
Am7          D7        Am7     D7             Am7     D7   G
 Later we'll have some pumpkin pie, and we'll do some caro-ling.

[Bridge 1]
C                           Bm
 You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear;
Em      Emaj    Em7               A7  N.C.            D7
 Voices singing; "let's be jolly; deck the halls with boughs of holly".

[Verse 3]
G                                          D7
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday.
Am7       D7      Am7   D7         Am7     D7        G
 Everyone dancing merri-ly, in the new old-fashioned way.
