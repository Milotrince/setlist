[Intro] D Cadd9 G D

[Verse 1]
D
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Cadd9
Reminds me of childhood memories
       G                                         D
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see her face 
    Cadd9
She takes me away to that special place 
           G                                        D
And if I stare too long I'd probably break down and cry 

[Chorus]
A    C                   D
Oooooh Sweet Child of Mine
Oooooh Sweet Love of Mine

[Instrumental] D Cadd9 G D

[Verse 2]
D
She's got eyes of the bluest sky
Cadd9
And if they thought of rain 
G                                     D
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      Cadd9
Where as a child I'd hide
     G                                      D
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by 

[Chorus]
[Instrumental] D Cadd9 G D x2
[Chorus] x2
[Instrumental] Em C B A x4; Em G A C D x4
 
[Outro]
Em              G               A                 C C D D
Where do we go, Where do we go, Where do we go now        x2
Em             G     A                  C           D
Where do we goooo , where do we go now Now-now-now-now-now-now-now
Em     G             A C D      Em  
Sweet child, sweet chi-. . ld of mine
