F#maj7  F#6
A#m7   A#7sus4   A#m7
G#m7  C#7b9  F#


[Verse 1]
F#maj7                  F#6
In a little while from now,
       A#m7                 A#7sus4
If I'm not feeling any less sour
  C#m7
I promised myself to treat myself
    A#m7b5         D#7b9
And visit a nearby tower,
      G#m7
And climbing to the top,
       G#m7b5        Bm6
Will throw myself off
      F#                F#aug
In an effort to make it clear to who
     F#6                        F7
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
     A#m                           C#m
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
                D#7b9 D#7
Where people're say___ing,
    G#m7
"My God that's tough, she stood him up!
    G#m7b5          Bm6
No point in us remaining.
  F#maj7          F#6
We may as well go home."
    A#m  A#m7  D#9
As I did on my own...
  G#m7      C#7b9    F#
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 2]
    F#maj7                 F#6
To think that only yesterday,
      A#m7                 A#7sus4
I was cheerful, bright and gay,
         C#m7
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do,
     A#m7b5               D#7b9
The role I was about to play
       G#m7
But as if to knock me down,
   G#m7b5        Bm6
Rea__lity came around
      F#                 F#aug
And without so much as a mere touch,
       F#6         F7
Cut me into little pieces
A#m
Leaving me to doubt,
          C#m          D#7b9 D#7
Talk about God and His mer___cy
     G#m7
Who if He really does exist
G#m7b5            Bm6
Why did He desert me
F#maj7         F#6
In my hour of need?
    A#m  A#m7  D#9
I truly am in__deed,
  G#m7      C#7b9    F#
Alone again, naturally


[Bridge]
    A
It seems to me that

There are more hearts
E7              E7/D
broken in the world 
               G#m7b5
that can't be mended
C#7b9      A
 Left unattended
D#m7b5       C#maj7            C#9/G# C#7
 What do we do?___ What do we do?

[Interlude]
F#maj7  F#6  A#m7   A#7sus4
C#m7    A#m7b5   D#7b9 D#7
G#m7    G#m7b5
F#  F#aug  F#6  F7
A#m   C#m  D#7b9  D#7
G#m7  G#m7b5  Bm6
F#maj7  F#6  A#m   A#m7   D#9

[Refrain]
  G#m7     C#7b9    F#
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 3]
    F#maj7                 F#6
Now looking back over the years,
        A#m7              A#7sus4
And whatever else that appears
     C#m7
I remember I cried when my father died
      A#m7b5               D#7b9 D#7
Never wishing to hide the tears
        G#m7
And at sixty five years old,
    G#m7b5
My mother, God rest her soul,
          F#                 F#aug
Couldn't understand, why the only man
        F#6                 F7
She had ever loved had been taken
A#m                          C#m
Leaving her to start with a heart
         D#7b9 D#7
So badly bro___ken
    G#m7
Despite encouragement from me
     G#m7b5        Bm6
No words were ever spoken
    F#maj7            F#6
And when she passed away
    A#m       A#m7    D#9
I cried and cried all day

[Outro]
  G#m7     C#7b9    F#/A#  A#m7   D#7
Alone again, naturally
  G#m7      C#7b9 C#7     F#
Alone again,______naturally
