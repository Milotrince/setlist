[Verse 1]
C                              F                          C
I'm feelin rough  I'm feelin   raw I'm in the prime of my life
                                F                          C
Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives
                               F                        C
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars
                           F                       C
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars


[Pre-Chorus]
F
This is our decision to live fast and die young.
                                          C
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
F
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
                                                C
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?


[Chorus 1]

G                                Em
Forget about our mothers and our friends.
        F     G     C
We were fated to pretend
        F           C
              to pretend
We were fated to pretend
              to pretend


[Verse 2]
C                                 F                      C
I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms
C                           F                            C
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
C                            F                          C
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
C                                  F                          C
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone


[Pre-Chorus]
F
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
                                                 C
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew
F
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
                                                     C
we'll find some more models, everything must run its course


[Chorus]

G                                             Em
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
        F     G     C
We were fated to pretend
        F           C
              to pretend
We were fated to pretend
              to pretend

I said, yea yea yeah
        yea yea yeah
        yea yea yeah
        yea yea yeah
