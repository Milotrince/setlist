Capo 2

[Verse 1]
C   C/E                                  F              G
     When your legs don't work like they used to before
C   C/E                                F    G
     And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C   C/E                                  F           G
     Will your mouth still remember the  taste of my love
C   C/E                         F      G
     Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
            C   C/E           F   G          C  C/E    F G
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
            C  C/E                  F  G        C    C/E
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23 
F                         G
And I'm thinking bout how 

[Pre-Chorus]
Dm                         G      C     Dm
People fall in love in mysterious ways, Maybe just the touch of hand
     Dm                          G          Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day 
    Dm                      G               C       C/E
And I just wanna tell you I am; So honey now..

[Chorus]
F G                          C    C/E
   Take me into your loving arms 
F G                            C        C/E
  Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
F            G                  C     C/E
  Place your head on my beating heart 
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am  G    F    C/E     Dm   G   C
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
C        C/E                               F           G
  And when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C     C/E                           F     G
  And the crowds don't remember my name
C     C/E               F          G
  When my hands don't play the strings the same way
C   C/E                              F     G
  I know you will still love me the same



           C      C/E               F     G            C  C/E        F   G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C     C/E            F  G            C     C/E
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
F                G
And I'm thinking bout how 

[Pre-Chorus]
Dm                        G       C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                         G
And maybe it's all part of plan
      Dm                      G     Am
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistake 
Dm                    G
Hoping that you'll understand
C              C/E
That baby now..

[Chorus]

[Instrumental] C    C/E   F  G  x4

[Chorus]

[Outro]
     Am  G    F      C/E   Dm   G   C
Baby we found love right where we are
     Am  G    F   C/E    Dm   G   C
And we found love right where we are
