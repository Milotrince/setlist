[Intro]

| Caug     | E7   F   | Fm/Ab  G7   | C        |


[Verse 1]

Am               C
   Slow down you crazy child
       G                 Bb
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
            F                       C
But then if you're so smart tell me why
                   D    E9sus4  E
Are you still so afraid

Am                              C
   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
          G                       Bb
You better cool it off before you burn it out
        F
You got so much to do and only
C                   Bm    E9sus4  E
So many hours in a day


[Chorus]

F                             G
   But you know that when the truth is told
             C             Em/B
That you can get what you want
           Am        C/G
Or you can just get old
            F                    Bm7        E7   Am7      D7
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
              Ab7
When will you realize
G                  C
  Vienna waits for you


[Verse 2]

Am                  C
   Slow down you're doing fine
             G
You can't be everything you want to be
  Bb
Before your time
              F                 C              D        E9sus4  E
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight

Am                      C
   Too bad but it's the life you lead
           G
You're so ahead of yourself
            Bb
That you forgot what you need
               F
Though you can see when you're wrong
             C                             Bm            E9sus4 E
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're ri  -   ight


[Chorus]

F                            G
   You got your passion, you got your pride
    C                   Em/B       Am        C/G
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
F                       Bm7            E7      Am7   D7
   Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
              Ab7
When will you realize
G             C
  Vienna waits for you


[Instrumental]

| Am   C   | G    Bb       |
| F    C   | Bm   E9sus4 E |


[Chorus]

F                 G
   Slow down you crazy child
             C             Em/B
And take the phone off the hook
         Am          C/G
And disappear for a while
F                          Bm7            E7    Am7   D7
   It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two
              Ab7
When will you realize
G             C
  Vienna waits for you

F                             G
   And you know that when the truth is told
             C             Em/B
That you can get what you want
           Am        C/G
Or you can just get old
            F                    Bm7      E7     Am7      D7
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
              Ab7
Why don't you realize
G            C
  Vienna waits for you
