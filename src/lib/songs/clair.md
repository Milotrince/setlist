[Verse 1]
Em9 Em7     Am9      Am7        D9
Clair,  the moment I met you I swear,
  Bm7                      Em9 Em7
I felt as if something somewhere
    Am7                   F#m7-5     B7       Em9 Em7
Had happened to me,  wich I couldn´t see. And then
    Am9      Am7      D9
The moment I met you again,
  Bm7                            Em9  Em7
I knew in my heart that we were friends
   Am7              F#m7-5      D7      Gmaj7
It had to be so, it couldn´t be no; But try
   Bdim7                Am7
as hard as I might do I don´t know why,
D13        D9            Gmaj7
You get to me in a way I can´t describe.
Cmaj7                         C#m7-5/E
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
             G/D
I don´t care what people say.
              C#m7-5/E              Cmaj7  Am9   D9
To me, you´re more than a child. Oh Clair, Clair___.

[Verse 2]
Em9 Em7   Am9    Am7       D9
Clair, if ever a moment so rare
    Bm7                    Em9 Em7
was captured for all to compare
     Am7               F#m7-5       B7      Gmaj7
That moment is you, in all that you do. But why
   Bdim7                       Am7
In spite of our age diff´rence do I cry
D13           D9               Gmaj7
- each time I leave you I feel I could die,
Cmaj7                         C#m7-5/E
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say:
              G/D
"I´m going to marry you, will
          C#m7-5/E
you marry me, Uncle Ray?"
   Cmaj7      Am9   D9
Oh Clair,     Clair___.

[Verse 3]
Em9 Em7      Am9        Am7             D9
Clair,  I´ve told you before, don´t you dare
    Gmaj7     Em9            Am7            D9
Get back into bed, can´t you see that it´s late,
       Bm7           Em9
No you can´t have a drink.
     Am7            D9          Gmaj7
Oh alright then but wait just a bit
      Bdim7             Am7
While I in an effort to baby sit
D7                              Gmaj7
capture my breath what there is left of it.
Cmaj7                     C#m7-5/E
You can be murder at this hour of the day
           G/D
But in the morning, this hour will seem a
C#m7-5/E
lifetime away.
   Cmaj7      Am9   D9
Oh Clair,     Clair___

[Outro]

Clair                          Oh Clair.
