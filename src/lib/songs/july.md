[Intro]
| Am  | C   | F   | F   | x2

[Verse 1]
Am                   C
I've been holding my breath
                      F
I've been counting to 10

Over something you said
Am                     C
I've been holding back tears
                           F
While you're throwing back beers

I'm alone in bed


[Pre-Chorus]
      Am    C             F
You know I, I'm afraid of change
          Am    C            F
Guess that's why we stay the same


[Chorus]
N.C.          C
So tell me to leave
             Am               F
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
                  Am
Find someone that loves you
               C              F
Better than I do, darling, I know
            G
'Cause you remind me every day
          Am                 Dm  N.C.
I'm not enough, but I still stay


[Verse 2]
Am                C
Feels like a lifetime
               F
Just tryna get by

While we're dying inside
Am                         C
I've done a lot of things wrong
                 F
Loving you being one

But I can't move on


[Pre-Chorus]
      Am    C             F
You know I, I'm afraid of change
          Am    C            F
Guess that's why we stay the same


[Chorus]
N.C.          C
So tell me to leave
             Am               F
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
                  Am
Find someone that gives you
             C                  F
All of the things I could not know
           G
'Cause I keep fighting all the way
           Am           Dm   N.C.
I let you down so I could stay


[Bridge]
N.C.               Am
If you want me to leave
                 C                   F
Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go

And baby, I'll go


[Whistle]
| Am  | C   | F   | F   | x2
| Dm  | Am  | F   | F   | x2


[Outro]
      N.C.
You remind me every day

I'm not enough, but I still stay
