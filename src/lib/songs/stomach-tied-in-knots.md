Capo 2

[Verse 1]
       Em
Oh, my stomach's tied in knots
      G                                      Cmaj7
I'm afraid of what I'll find if you want to talk tonight, oo-oh oo-oo-ooh
        Em                           G
See the problem isn't you, it's me I know
                            C
I can tell, I've seen it time after time
                     G       C            Em      C
And I'll push you away      mm I get so afraid, oh no

[Chorus]
                      Em        G      C
And I can't live without you now, oh-oh 
                   Em         G        C
I can't even live with myself, Oh-oh-oh
                      Em        G      C
And I can't live without you now, oh-oh
                      Em      G        C
And I don't want nobody else,  Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
(muted) Em              F#m              G                       C
I only have myself to blame,  but do you think we can start again
                     Em        G        C
'Cause I can't live without you

Oh, my stomach's tied in knots

I'm afraid of what I'll find if I see you with him tonight, oo-oh oo-oo-ooh

See the problem isn't you, it's me I know
