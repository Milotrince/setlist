Capo 4

[Intro] G Am C G  x2

[Verse 1]
G                               Am
 Here's a little song I wrote;   You might want to sing it note for note
      C         G
Don't worry, be happy.
    G                               Am
In every life we have some trouble;  But when you worry you make it double
   C        G               Am/G             G
Don't worry, be happy.   Don't worry, be happy now.

[Chorus]
G Am              C         G
       Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
       Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.

[Verse 2]
G                                     Am
 Ain't got no place to lay your head;  Somebody came and took your bed
       C         G
Don't worry, be happy.
G                                    Am
 The landlord say your rent is late;  He may have to litigate
   C        G               Am/G             G
Don't worry, be happy.   Look at me -- I'm happy.

[Chorus]
G Am              C         G
       Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
(Here I give you my phone number. When you worry, call me, I make you happy.)
       Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.

[Verse 3]
G                                       Am
 Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style;  Ain't got no gal to make you smile
         C        G
Don't worry, be happy.
G                                              Am
'Cause when you worry your face will frown; And that will bring everybody down
   C        G               Am/G             G
Don't worry, be happy.   Don't worry, be happy now.

[Chorus]
[Outro] C G Am
Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it. Be happy. Put a smile on your face.
Don't bring everybody down.
Don't worry. It will soon pass, whatever it is. Don't worry, be happy.                                
   I'm not worried, I'm happy...
