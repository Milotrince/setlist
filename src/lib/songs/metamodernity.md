[Intro]
Dm7  Bbmaj7  Gm7     Fmaj7
Dm7  G       Bbmaj7  Fmaj7
 
Dm7  Bbmaj7  Gm7     Fmaj7
Dm7  G       Bbmaj7  Fmaj7
 
Dm7  Bbmaj7
 
 
[Verse 1]
               Gm7
Next to Hudson Yards
                    Fmaj7
It's crowded on the weekdays
Dm7
  From April to May
G               Bbmaj7
  Parse apart a troubled heart
        Fmaj7
From an E Train
    Dm7           C   Bbmaj7
And sing about it in LA
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm7                  Fmaj7
  With clouds in the rearview
          Dm7
You start humming along
       G
To the first verse
        Bbmaj7
Of your favorite song
         Fmaj7
That you quote each day
         Dm7
With the words all wrong
 
 
[Chorus]
   Bbmaj7           Gm7
So call me when the world looks bleak
  Fmaj7             Dm7
I love you but it's hard to believe
     G               Bbmaj7
With every day we'll start to see
    Fmaj7       Dm7
The rest is metamodernity
 
 
[Interlude]
     Bbmaj7  Gm7     Fmaj7
Dm7  G       Bbmaj7  Fmaj7
 
Dm7  Bbmaj7
 
 
[Verse 3]
              Gm7
With agrestic charm
                  Fmaj7
It's humid in the Midwest
     Dm7       Cmaj7
From June to July
G               Bbmaj7
  All beneath a pinkish sky
         Fmaj7
From the wildfires
      Dm7           C    Bbmaj7
Which mantle the horizon line
 
Gm7  Fmaj7  Dm7
 
 
[Verse 4]
C          G
  From the outset
          Bbmaj7
It's been hard to tell
        Fmaj7
Why I'd feel this down
        Dm7       C
When it all bodes well
 
 
[Chorus]
   Bbmaj7           Gm7
So call me when the world looks bleak
  Fmaj7             Dm7
I love you but it's hard to believe
     G               Bbmaj7
With every day we'll start to see
    Fmaj7       Dm7
The rest is metamodernity
 
 
[Outro]
     Bbmaj7  Gm7     Fmaj7
Dm7  G       Bbmaj7  Fmaj7
 
Dm7  F
