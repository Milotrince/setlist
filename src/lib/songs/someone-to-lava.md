Capo 5
[Intro] G
[Verse 1] G D7 C G D7
A long long time ago, there was a volcano
Living all alone, in the middle of the sea.
He sat high above his bay, watching all the couples play,
and he was wishing that he had someone too.
And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang out loud,
every day, for years and years.

[Chorus] C G D7 G; C G C D7 G
I have a dream I hope will come true,
that you’re here with me and I’m here with you.
I wish that the earth, sea, and sky up above
will send me someone to lava.

[Verse 2]
Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone, until
he was on the brink of extinction.
But little did he know that living in the sea below
another volcano was listening to his song.
Every day she heard his tune, her lava grew and grew because she
believed his song was meant for her.
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
as he sang his song of hope for the last time.

[Chorus]
[Verse]
Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano
looking all around but she could not see him.
He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone,
but with no lava his song was all done.
He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear
as she remembered what his song meant to her.

[Chorus] (Female)
[Verse]
Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea,
all together now their lava grew and grew.
No longer are they alone with Aloha as their new home,
and when you visit them, this is what they sing

[Chorus]
[Both]   I have a dream I hope will come true.
[Male]   That you'll grow old with me,
[Female] and I'll grow old with you.
[Both]   We thank the earth, sea, and sky we thank too

[Outro] C D7 G
I lava you x3
