[Intro]  Em   D6/9   (x2)

[Verse 1]  Em   D6/9
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]  Em9   Dmaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 2]  Em   D6/9
After two days in the desert sun
   Em                 D6/9
My skin began to turn red
      Em                D6/9
After three days in the desert fun
      Em                  D6/9
I was looking at a river bed
        Em                 D6/9
And the story it told of a river that flowed
        Em                  D6/9
Made me sad to think it was dead


[Chorus]  Em9   Dmaj9
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Solo]  Em   D6/9   x4

[Verse 3]  Em  D6/9
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]  Em9   Dmaj9
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la lala la la la, la, la   (x8)
