[Intro]
D E C#m D Bm C#m A
 
[Verse]
D   E            C#m            D        Bm
Not everyone can be like me and Michael
         C#m            A                           F#m
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
                 E                   A           D
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
     Bm                E                   A     Bm
Like all the rest, but they can't find out
 
D  E            C#m              D         Bm
In every scene,     it's me and Michael
      C#m        A                            F#m
Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds
                E                  A             D
So it seems the danger signs will never let the feelings die
     Bm                 E                  A
When all the best and brightest have gone
 
[Chorus]
       D       E  E6 E  A  A    Asus2     F#m
Me and Michael    Solid as they come
       Bm      E  E6   E   E  A    A  Asus2   F#m
Me and Michael    It's not a question now
 
            Bm       E   E6 E  A  A    Asus2     F#m
It's me and Michael      Solid as they come
       Bm      E   E6   E   E A     A  Asus2      F#m
Me and Michael     It's not a question now
       D
Me and Michael
 
[Instrumental]
D E C#m D Bm C#m A
D E C#m D Bm C#m A -> two bars
 
[Verse]
D  E             C#m                  D      Bm
Binary star sink     like the setting sun
          C#m               A                               F#m
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
                  E                 A             D
So you think the losing side would never break dividing lines
      Bm       E                       A
When sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt
 
[Chorus]
        D       E   E6 E  A  A    Asus2     F#m
Me and Michael      Solid as they come
       Bm      E   E6   E   E A   A    Asus2    F#m
Me and Michael     It's not a question now
 
            Bm      E   E6 E  A  A    Asus2    F#
It's me and Michael     Solid as they come
       Bm      E    E6   E   E A   A    Asus2    F#m
Me and Michael      It's not a question now
 
       D
Me and Michael
