[Verse 1]
C                        D
I found you here right beside me
               C                       D
Saying all the things you’ve never done
C                           D
 There’s not much time than less to say
         C               D
Oh please, just come away
          C
You could be my lady
          D        G              C
And we’ll walk the streets for no reason, maybe
     D        G             C
Just till you see you won’t be so lonely
     D           G            C         D
When you’re with me you won’t ever be so lonely
 
[Chorus]
Am                  D           Bm               Em
She’s well known to police, cuz she looks like a riot
Am                D             Bm                Em
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Am                  D            Bm             Em
All this love would kill me, but I don't think I mind
Am              D            Bm
Blame it on the way we don't even care
   Em              C        D     G     C  D G
We know we'll be alright, alright yeah
 
[Verse 2]
C                      D
 We fall asleep in the morning light
                C                  D
Oh, and when we dream we just might
C              D                             C       D
 Find a way to make sense of everything we've seen tonight
          C
You could be my lady
          D        G              C
And we’ll walk the streets for no reason, maybe
     D        G             C
Just till you see you won’t be so lonely
     D           G            C          D
When you’re with me you won’t ever be so lonely
 
[Chorus]
Am                  D           Bm               Em
She’s well known to police, cuz she looks like a riot
Am                D             Bm                Em
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Am                  D            Bm             Em
All this love would kill me, but I don't think I mind
Am              D            Bm
Blame it on the way we don't even care
   Em              C            D   G
We know we'll be alright, be alright
 
[Post-Chorus]
    C      D G    C  D G
Be alright
      C    D    G
We'll be alright
 
[Bridge]
Cmaj7                D6  D       Cmaj7  D6 D
 Wake up, turn around, you’re my girl
Cmaj7              D6
 If you stick with me
     D         Cmaj7     D6
Then you won’t ever be so lonely
 
[Chorus]
Am                  D           Bm               Em
She’s well known to police, cuz she looks like a riot
Am                D             Bm                Em
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Am                  D            Bm             Em
All this love would kill me, but I don't think I mind
Am              D            Bm
Blame it on the way we don't even care
   Em         C             D    G    C  D G
We know we'll be alright, alright
