[Intro]
D
 
 
[Verse]
F#m D                Bm     A
I don't know what to do without you
F#m D                 Bm      A
I don't know where to put my hands
F#m   D             Bm      A
I've been trying to lay my head down
        G               A    D
But I'm writing this at 3am
 
 
[Chorus]
G       A        D    F#m  G
I don't need the world to see
          G        A          D   F#m
That I've been the best I can be, but
G       A             D    F#m G
I don't think I could stand to be
      G         A    F#m
Where you don't see me

[Verse]
F#m D           Bm      A
On sunny days I go out walking
F#m D         Bm          A
I end up on a tree-lined street
F#m D             Bm     A
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
D F#m  G             A   D
I miss you more than anything
 
 
[Chorus]
G       A        D    F#m  G
I don't need the world to see
          G        A          D   F#m
That I've been the best I can be, but
G       A             D    F#m  G
I don't think I could stand to be
      G         A   E
Where you don't see me
 
 
[Chorus]
     G     A                 D   F#m  G
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
         G      A       D   F#m
With the summer passing by, but
G       A              D    F#m  G
I don't think I could stand to be
      G         A   F#m
Where you don't see me
