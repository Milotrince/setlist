Capo 9
[Intro] Em7  D/F#  G  x4

[Verse] Em7  D/F#  G
I know a man with nothing in his hands,
Nothing but a rolling stone
He told me 'bout when his house burnt down,
He lost everything he owned

He lay asleep for six whole weeks,
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose

[Chorus] C G D Em
Now I've got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt,
A whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money's gone, well life carries on
And I miss it like a hole in the head

[Instrumental] Em7    D/F#  G   x4

[Verse] Em7  D/F#  G
I know a woman with kids around her ankles
And a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
And the motherf**ker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise,
But keeping wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked
So why you gotta worry me for

[Chorus] C G D Em
Now he left a hole in my heart, a hole in a promise
A hole on the side of my bed
But now that he's gone well life carries on
And I miss him like a hole in the head

[Bridge]
     C                   G                    D
Well sometimes you can't change and you can't choose
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose

[Outro]
              Am           C
Now we've got holes in our hearts
               G            D
Yeah we've got holes in our lives
               Am           C                  G
Well we've got holes we got holes but we carry on   x2 / x6
