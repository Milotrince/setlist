[Intro]
Am  F х2

[Verse 1]
Am
 Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night,
    F
and wouldn't you love to love her?
Am
 Takes to the sky like a bird in flight,
    F
and who will be her lover?

C                                  F
 All your life you've never seen a woman;

taken by the wind
C
 Would you stay if she promised you heaven;
F
 will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
Am
 She is like a cat in the dark,
    F
and then she is the darkness
Am
 She rules her life like a fine skylark,
F
 when the sky is starless

C                                  F
 All your life you've never seen a woman;

taken by the wind
C
 Would you stay if she promised you heaven;
F
 will you ever win?
F
 Will you ever win?

[Chorus]
F    Am   F    Am   F    Am   F    Am
Rhiannon, Rhiannon, Rhiannon, Rhiannon

[Verse 3]
Am
 She rings like a bell through the night,
    F
and wouldn't you love to love her?
Am
 She rules her life like a bird in flight,
    F
and who will be her lover?

C                                  F
 All your life you've never seen a woman;

taken by the wind
C
 Would you stay if she promised you heaven;
F
 will you ever win?
F
 Will you ever win?

[Chorus]
F    Am   F    Am   F    Am   F    Am
Rhiannon, Rhiannon, Rhiannon, Rhiannon

F     Am               F
Taken by, taken by the sky
Am                     F
Taken by, taken by the sky
Am                     F
Taken by, taken by the sky

Am  F х7

[Outro]
Am                                  F
Dreams unwind and love's a state of mind
Am                                  F
Dreams unwind and love's a state of mind . . . .
