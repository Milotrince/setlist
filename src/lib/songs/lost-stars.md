[Intro] Fmaj7

[Verse 1] Fmaj7
Please don't see just a girl caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
         Em                              Fmaj7
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
           Em                                   Fmaj7
Best laid plans sometimes it's just a one night stand
         Em                              Fmaj7
I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
               G            G
So let's get drunk on our tears

[Chorus]
    Fmaj7            Cmaj7                         Fmaj7
And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
             Cmaj7                          Fmaj7
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
              Em
Searching for meaning
            D                         Dm           G
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

[Verse] Fmaj7
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
           Em                                   Fmaj7
Don't you dare let all those memories bring you sorrow
     Em                       Fmaj7
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
          Em                               Fmaj7
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
               G             G
Where we're dancing in our tears

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Fmaj7                        Cmaj7
I thought I saw you out there crying
Fmaj7                       Cmaj7
I thought I heard you call my name
Fmaj7                          Cmaj7           G
I thought I saw you out there crying, But just the same

[Chorus], [Outro]
        D                         Dm     Fmaj7 G     Cmaj7
Are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
