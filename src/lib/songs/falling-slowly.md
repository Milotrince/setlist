[Intro]
C F C F
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                 F              C                F
I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that
C                         F               C             F
Words fall through me and always fool me, and I can't react
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am         G      F        G                 Am         G               F
Games that never amount to more than they're meant will play themselves out
 
 
[Chorus]
C                 F                 Am                     F
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
C                  F                 Am                     F
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now
 
 
[Verse 2]
C               F               C              F
Falling slowly, eyes that know me, and I can't go back
C                  F             C               F
Moods that take me and erase me, and I'm painted black
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am       G         F         G               Am         G             F
You have suffered enough and warred with yourself, it's time that you won
 
 
[Chorus]
C                 F                 Am                    F
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
C                  F                  Am                     F
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now

[Chorus]
C                 F                 Am                    F
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
C                  F                  Am                     F
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now
C              F             Am             F
Falling slowly sing your melody, I'll sing along
