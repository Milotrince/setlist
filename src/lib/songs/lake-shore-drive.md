Capo 4

[Intro]
C - Am - Em - Em
 
 
           C                Am              Em               F
There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
C          CM9/B     Am                       Em
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
     F              C             Em              F
From rats on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
C           CM9/B    Am      Em   F                 C
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
        Em                         F                                 C
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by
 
 
(piano break) C Am Em Em
 
 
           F                  Em
And there ain't no road just like it
F           Em
Anywhere I found
C       CM9/B     Am         Em    F            C
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
      Em               F                         C
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound
 
(piano break) C Am Em Em
 
 
 
 
 
*It all repeats for the other two verses/choruses, but here's a repeat of the chords with the lyrics*
 
 
        C                    Am         Em                   F
And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
C        CM9/B     Am                    Em
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
F                 C                       Em              F
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
      C        CM9/B  Am      Em       F                  C
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
            Em                   F                                        C
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive
 
 
(piano break) C Am Em Em
 
 
           F                 Em
And there ain't no road just like it
F           Em
Anywhere I found
C       CM9/B    Am         Em    F            C
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
     Em                F                         C
Just slicking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound
 
 
(piano break) C Am Em Em
 
 
         C                       Am
And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
    Em                 F
Too early to start the rounds
  C          CM9/B         Am                   Em
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you're pleasure bound
         F                   C                      Em                F
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
     C            CM9/B    Am         Em       F                 C
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
         Em                     F                                 C
When the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day
 
(piano break) C Am Em Em
 
          F                  Em
And there ain't no road just like it
F           Em
Anywhere I found
C       CM9/B    Am         Em    F            C
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
      Em              F                         C
Just snaking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound
