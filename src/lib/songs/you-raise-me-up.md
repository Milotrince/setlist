[Intro] D G D; D/F# G A Asus4 A; Bm G D G; D A D

[Verse 1]
            D        G               D
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;             
              D/F#      G           A   Asus4     A
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;     
             Bm        G              D       G
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,   
            D      A              D
Until you come and sit awhile with me.              

[Chorus]
             Bm     G              D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
             Bm     G              D         A    
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
     Bm           G             D       G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
             D     A               D
You raise me up to more than I can be.

             C#m     A              E         B

       C#m        A              E      A
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas           
       Dm         Bb            F        Bb
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
             F       C               F
You raise me up to more than I can be.
