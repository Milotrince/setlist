[Intro]
G G G F


[Verse]
G
No one was crying
G
They simply got a little something in their eye
G
No one was lonely
F
They just could not get hold of anybody
G
Over the summer, a lot changed
G
And they all changed to keep up with it
G
Too complicated
F
Too complex to talk to anybody


[Chorus]
Dm/A                                   Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Rolling shadow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Fallen arrow)


[Verse]
G
All this is sky light
G
Forget that it's there but it's there, no doubt about it
G
Take a photo of it, come back years on
F
And wonder why you took it
G
Thousands of people
G
Tight lines and hopes the weather stays the weekend
G
Clouds and rain
F
And no one cares 'til they've got the marks to prove it


[Chorus]
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Rolling shadow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Fallen arrow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Rolling shadow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Fallen arrow)
G
(Rolling shadows, fallen arrows)

[Chorus]
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Rolling shadow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Fallen arrow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Rolling shadow)
Dm/A                                     Em/B
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it        (Fallen arrow)
