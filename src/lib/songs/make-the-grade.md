[Verse 1]
G                              Em                           C
Somewhere at the bottom of the ocean I am floating past the algae
    G/B              F#            A7
The whale bones so pretty, but my body
                        G    Gaug                        G    Gaug
Still didn't make the grade,      still didn't make the grade

[Verse 2]
G                                 Em                          C
Somewhere in the basement I once had a good idea but I can't find it
    G/B              F#            A7
My mind is drawing blanks to fill the page
                              G    Gaug                        G    Gaug
But I still won't make the grade,        still won't make the grade

[Chorus]

I'm regaining patience

In the better half of man

And the stories we'll remember

Are from a different hand

[Verse 3]
G                             Em                                   C
Somewhere at the bottom of my brain I just don't care and I don't want to
      G/B      F#        A7
But I do   anyway,   anyway
                         G    Gaug                        G    Gaug
I still won't make the grade,      still won't make the grade

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
G                              Em                           C
Somewhere at the bottom of the ocean I am floating past the algae
    G/B              F#            A7
The whale bones so pretty, but my body
                         G    Gaug                        G    Gaug
I still won't make the grade,      still won't make the grade
                         G    Gaug                        G    Gaug
I still won't make the grade,      still won't make the grade
