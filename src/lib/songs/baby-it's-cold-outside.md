[Verse 1]
    C          Cmaj7         C     Cmaj7
I really can't stay
               But baby it's cold outside
     Dm        G7          Dm     G7
I've got to go away
             But baby it's cold outside
     C          Cmaj7         C
The evening has been
             Been hoping that you'd drop in
        Gm7                 C7
So very nice
             I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
[Chorus]
   F
My mother will start worry
                    Beautiful whatâ€™s your hurry?
     Fm
And father will be pacing the floor
                                   Listen to the fireplace roar
    C
So really i'd better scurry
                   Beautiful please don't hurry
     Dm                       G
But maybe just a half a drink more
                              Put some records on while I pour
[Verse 2]
    C                Cmaj7    C        Cmaj7
The neighbors might think
                    Baby it's bad out there
      Dm             G7          Dm      G7
Say, what's in this drink?
                   No cabs to be had out there
   C           Cmaj7             C
I wish i knew how
              Your eyes are like starlight now
             Gm7              C7
To break the spell
               I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
[Chorus]
   F
I ought to say, "No, no, no sir"
                           Mind if I move in closer?
   Fm                          G7
At least i'm gonna say that i tried
                              What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?
    C          Bb7         A7
I really can't stay
               Baby don't hold out
             D7    G7  C
Ah, but it's cold outside

[Verse 3]
  C           Cmaj7      C  Cmaj7
I simply must go 
             Baby, it's cold outside
    Dm        G7               Dm  G7
The answer is no
             Ooh darling, it's cold outside
C  Cmaj7  C  C
This welcome has been
               I'm lucky that you dropped in
            Gm7              C7
So nice and warm 
                Look out the window at that storm
[Chorus]
   F
My sister will be suspicious 
                   Man, your lips look delicious
   Fm
My brother will be there at the door
                               Waves upon a tropical shore
   C
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
                         Gosh your lips are delicious
     Dm                        G
Well maybe just a half a drink more
                               Never such a blizzard before
[Verse 4]
     C         Cmaj7            C          Cmaj7
I've got to go home
               Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
      Dm          G7         Dm        G7
Say, lend me your coat 
             It's up to your knees out there
       C           Cmaj7          C
You've really been grand 
                I thrill when you touch my hand
              Gm7         C7
But don't you see?
              How can you do this thing to me?
[Chorus]
        F
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
                        Think of my life long sorrow
   Fm                          G7
At least there will be plenty implied 
                               If you caught pneumonia and died
   C           Bb7          A7
I really can't stay
              Get over that hold out
              D7   G7  C
Ahh, but it's cold outside
