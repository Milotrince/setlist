Capo 1

[Verse 1]
A             Ab7               G               Gb
Pessimists are all around, it's almost like they run this town
    Bm             Gb            Bm  A  Abm Gb7
The tax is up, The dow is down again
    D             Db7                 Gbm           B
But as we pass our days, you know I'm almost never fazed
       E/B                                E7
To the down-and-outs and nay-sayers, well this is what I say

[Chorus]
            A              Db7             Gbm               Em      A   D
It's pretty great, that you love me, and I love you, and we say so, everyday so
     A                   F               E7            
Even when the bubble burst, It's not the worst
            A            Db7                Gbm
It's rather nice just to hold you, when you hold me,
        Em         A      D
nothing wrong with feeling happy
     A              F                  E7               A
Even when we make a fuss, we still got us, we still got us

[Refrain]
A     Db     Gbm           A             D             A
Oh oh oh oh, Ba ba ba bara baraba baraba ba, still got us, still got
F        E
we still got us

[Verse 2]
A          Ab7                  G             Gb
Everybody's telling me, there's nothing decent on TV
     Bm              Gb             Bm  A  Abm Gb7
It's overdone, we've seen it all before
    D               Db7                 Gbm              B
But when I see your face, those know-it-alls are laid to waste
       E/B                        E7
To the critics and academies, I'm not afraid to say

[Chorus]

[Refrain] Dbm Gbm A D A F E7 x2

[Outro]
F        E
We still got us
