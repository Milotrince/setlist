[Intro]
C  F   C

[Verse 1]
N.C.       Gm7
I'm like a magnet
                    Bb F
You're like a piece of wood
            Gm7
Can't get together
                   Bb F
Don't make me feel so good

[Verse 2]
           Gm7
I'm like a convict
                Bb F
You're like the FBI
          Gm7
I ask for breakfast
            Bb       F
You bring a piece of pie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
C
I know it's useless to say
Dm             F
How it used to be
C
Why do you treat me this way?
Dm                  C
If you could only see


[Chorus]
              Gm     Bb
You're like a magnet
C                   Gm    Bb
I'm like a piece of steel
C                    F     C
The way you break my will

[Verse 3]
N.C.       Gm7
I'm like a rowboat
                      Bb F
You're like the Queen Mary
         Gm7
I play a tango
              Bb F
You play a symphony

[Pre-Chorus 2]
C
When we have a problem or two
Dm                    F
Can't you see I'm tryin'
C
When I see you smilin' like that
Dm                  C
Makes me change my mind

[Chorus]
              Gm     Bb
You're like a magnet
C                   Gm    Bb
I'm like a piece of steel

The way you break my will
