Capo 4

 
[Intro]
Bm         Em
A          D
G          Em            F#
 
 
[Verse]
Bm          Em
My heart is paralyzed
A           D
My head was oversized
G             Em               F#
I'll take the high road like I should
Bm            Em
You said it's meant to be
A             D
That it's not you, it's me
G              Em             F#
You're leaving now for my own good
 
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
 
 
[Chorus]
         G
She went down in an airplane
D
Fried getting suntanned
A                Bm            A
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
G                       D           C#m          F#
Help me, help me I'm no good at goodbyes
          G
She met a shark underwater
D
Fell and no one caught her
A          Bm                A
I returned everything I ever bought her
G                        D      F#
Help me, help me I'm all out of lies
 
And ways to say you died
 
Bm         Em
A          D
G          Em            F#
 
 
[Verse]
Bm             Em
My pride still feels the sting
A           D
You were my everything
G            Em               F#
Someday I'll find a love like yours (A love like yours)
Bm               Em
She'll think I'm Superman
A         D
Not super minivan
G             Em              F#
How could you leave on Yom Kippur
 
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
 
 
[Chorus]
        G
She was caught in a mudslide
D
Eaten by a lion
A                 Bm            A
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
G                       D           C#m        F#
Help me, help me I'm no good at goodbyes
          G
She dried up in the desert
D
Drowned in a hot tub
A                     Bm        A
Danced to death at an east side nightclub
G                        D      F#
Help me, help me I'm all out of lies
 
And ways to say you died
 
Bm         Em
A          D
G          Em            F#          G
 
 
[Bridge]
  A
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
  G
I wanna be the one you're dying to
A      G
Love...but you don't want to
 
F#
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
F#
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
