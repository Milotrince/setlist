[Verse 1]
     C      G/B        F/A       C/G
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    F       C/E            D      G
The regular crowd shuffles in
           C     G/B       F/A         C/G
There's an old man sitting next to me
       F           F/G       C
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

[Interlude]  C  G/B  F/A  C/G ;   F  F/G  C  %  F/C  % 
[Verse 2]
          C            G/B       F/A      C/G
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    F          C/E         D      G
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            G/B         F/A        C/G
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     F        F/G           C
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

[Bridge]
Am    Am/G      D7/F#   F

[Chorus]
C         G/B              F/A      C/G
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C/E    D      G
Sing us a song tonight
            C         G/B         F/A      C/G
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F             F/G       C
And you've got us feelin' alright

[Interlude] C  G/B  F/A  C/G ;  F  F/G

[Verse 3] C  G/B  F/A  C/G ; F  C/E  D  G  C  G/B  F/A  C/G ; F  F/G  C  C
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

[Verse 4]
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

[Bridge]
[Verse 5]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

[Interlude] C  G/B  F/A  C/G ; F  F/G  C  %  F/C  % 

[Verse 6]
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

[Solo]

[Verse 7]
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while

[Verse 8]
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

[Bridge]
