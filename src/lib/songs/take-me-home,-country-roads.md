[Intro] A

[Verse 1]
A              F#m
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
E                     D          A
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                   F#m
Life is old there, older than the trees,
E                           D              A
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.

[Chorus]
A                      E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong: 
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
Take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]
A                F#m
All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
E             D                A
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                F#m
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
E                         D              A
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
F#m        E             A
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me,
    D       A              E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    F#m              G
And drivin' down the road,
        D              A                     E                E7
I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
        E             A
Take me home, country roads.
Take me home, down country roads.
