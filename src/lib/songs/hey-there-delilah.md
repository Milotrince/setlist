[Intro]
D  F#m  D  F#m
 
[Verse 1]
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City?
      D                               F#m
I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty,
        Bm  G                 A                  Bm
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you,
             A
I swear it’s true.
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance,
          D                                  F#m
I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen,
           Bm    G            A                Bm
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise,
            A
I’m by your side.
 
[Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm     A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
D                      Bm  D                      Bm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
               D
What you do to me.
 
[Verse 2]
D                         F#m
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard,
           D                                    F#m
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar,
              Bm    G              A               Bm
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would,
           A
My word is good.
D                           F#m
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say,
         D                                 F#m
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away,
             Bm   G            A                  Bm
I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall,
             A
We’d have it all.
 
[Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
 
[Bridge]
  G                                    A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars,
    D                             Bm
I’d walk to you if I had no other way
    G                                     A
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because,
   D                                     Bm
We know that none of them have felt this way,
  G                             A
Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through,
    Bm                                               A
The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
 
[Verse 3]
D                        F#m
Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me,
         D                                         F#m
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history,
       Bm  G                A              Bm
Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you,
G             A            Bm
We can do whatever we want to,
G           A               Bm                  A
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
 
[Final Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
D                      Bm  D                      Bm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,
               D
What you do to me.
   Bm   D    Bm    D    Bm   D    Bm   D D (full strum)
Ohhh
