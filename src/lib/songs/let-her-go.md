Capo 7

[Intro] F F F G Am Am G G x4

[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C
Only know you love her when you let her go
G
(  And you let her go)

[Instrumental] Am   F   G   Em; Am   F   G

[Verse 1] Am   F   G   Em; Am   F   G
Am                            F              G                          Em
Staring at the bottom of your glass, Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                  Am              F          G
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                          F          G                         Em
You see her when you close your eyes, Maybe one day you'll understand why
               Am            F        G
Everything you touch surely dies

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Am                            F              G                     Em
Staring at the ceiling in the dark, Same old empty feeling in your heart
                    Am              F       G
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F                  G                  Em
Well you see her when you fall asleep, But never to touch and never to keep
                         Am                   F        G
'Cause you loved her too much, And you dived too deep

[Chorus]


[Bridge] Am   F   G   Em; Am   F   G  x4
And you let her go, Ooooo ooooo oooooo x2

[Chorus], [Chorus] (One Strum)
