[Intro]
C   C/B   Dm   Gsus4   G   x2
 
[Verse 1]
C              C/B
I walked across an empty land
Dm                          Gsus4          G
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
C               C/B
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Dm                       Gsus4        G
Sat by the river, and it made me complete
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am               Em
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
Dm                           F             G
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
Am             Em
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
Dm                             F             G
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
 
 
[Verse 2]
C              C/B
I came across a fallen tree
Dm                         Gsus4     G
I felt the branches of it looking at me
C                C/B
Is this the place we used to love?
Dm                               Gsus4    G
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am               Em
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
Dm                          F              G
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
Am             Em
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
Dm                             F             G
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
 
 
[Chorus]
F                 C                 G
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
F             C              G
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
F                 C           G
This could be the end of everything
Dm
So why don't we go
Em                     Dm
Somewhere only we know?
  Em                   Dm    G
Somewhere only we know?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                Em
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
Dm                         F              G
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
Am              Em
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
Dm                           F              G
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm                C/E               G
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Dm                C/E         G
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
Dm                C/E          G
This could be the end of everything
Dm
So why don't we go?
              Em
So why don't we go?
 
Ooh, aah over Instrumental
Dm    C  G  x2
 
 
[Outro]
Dm                C           G
This could be the end of everything
Dm
So why don't we go
Em             C       Dm
Somewhere only we know?
(Slowly)
  Em                  Dm
Somewhere only we know
Em             Dm    C
Somewhere only we know
