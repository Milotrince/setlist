[Intro] G A D Bm

[Verse 1]
     G          A
It's fine, it's cool
        D                               Bm
You can say that we are nothing but you know the truth
          G       A
And guess I'm the fool
         D                                  Bm
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

[Pre-Chorus]
Em9
 I don't wanna call it off
Em
 But you don't wanna call it love
Em9                             Em
 You only wanna be the one that I call baby

[Chorus]
   G                   A
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
  D                        Bm
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
   G                      A
You can say it's just the way you are
 D                          Bm
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
       G                    A
Good luck babe, well good luck babe
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
       G                    A
Good luck babe, well good luck babe
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Verse 2]
       G         A
I'm clich√©, "Who cares?"
       D                         Bm
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
      G             A
And I cry, it's not fair
       D                            Bm
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air

[Pre-Chorus]
Em9
 Think I'm gonna call it off
Em
 Even if you call it love
Em9                            Em
 I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

[Chorus]
   G                   A
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
  D                        Bm
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
   G                      A
You can say it's just the way you are
 D                          Bm
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
       G                    A
Good luck babe, well good luck babe
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
       G                    A
Good luck babe, well good luck babe
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Interlude]
Em9 Em Em9 Em

[Bridge]
             Em9                        Em
And when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
           Em9                               Em
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
             Em9                         Em
And when you think about me all of those years ago
                Em9                  Em
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
           N.C.
You know I hate to say it, I told you so
           Em9                   Em
You know I hate to say it but, I told you so

[Chorus]
   G                   A
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
  D                        Bm
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
   G                      A
You can say it's just the way you are
 D                          Bm
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
       G                                     A
Good luck babe (well good luck), well good luck babe (well good luck)
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
       G                                    A
Good luck babe (well good luck), well good luck babe (well good luck)
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Outro]
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
        D                             Bm
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
        D                             Bm          G
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling


(End of song slows down gradually so that by the end the pitch of the last chord is really F#.)
