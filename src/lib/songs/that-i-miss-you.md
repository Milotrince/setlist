[Intro]
C#m7
Amaj7   | G#m7   | F#m7   | Emaj7  G#
Amaj7   | G#m7   | F#m7   | Emaj7  C#m7
 
 
[Verse 1]
       Amaj7
Headed west now
         G#m
From the blighted plain
F#m7                           Emaj7       G#
    It's kind of gorgeous in a georgic way
         Amaj7
Staring outside
         G#m7
Watching every change
F#m7                            Emaj7      C#m7
    I think it's just a type of way to explain
 
 
[Chorus]
      Amaj7
How I miss you
      G#m7
How I hope you're fine
          F#m7
That I've been sad
        Emaj7    G#           Amaj7
Tracing Lichtensteins with my eyes closed
       G#m7
On the phone at night
       F#m7
Always bummed out
          Emaj7        C#m7
Cause the world's not right
        Dmaj7
At this time
 
 
[Interlude]
Amaj7  C#m7  F#m7  Dmaj7
Amaj7  C#m7  F#m7  G#
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Amaj7
At the drive-thru
         G#m7
With the headlights on
F#m7                             Emaj7 G#
    And now I'm feeling like I'm Roquentin
     Amaj7
In a streetcar
     G#m7
Near Corrine Marchand
F#m7                           Emaj7      C#m7
    I'll go Michel Legrand and set it to song
 
 
[Chorus]
      Amaj7
How I miss you
      G#m7
How I hope you're fine
          F#m7
That I've been sad
        Emaj7   G#            Amaj7
Tracing Lichtensteins with my eyes closed
       G#m7
On the phone at night
       F#m7       Emaj7  G#
Always bummed out
 
 
[Outro]
        Amaj7
Back in New York
       G#m7
In the August sun
          F#m7
Wandering Greenpoint
          Emaj7     G#
While the L still runs
      Amaj7
And I run back
     G#m7
To a different day
       F#m7
In the meantime
        Emaj7          C#m7    Dmaj7
You can dance, you can hit replay
