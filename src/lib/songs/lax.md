  Wheels up and I'm on my way

  Been three weeks since I've seen my baby
Fmaj7      (Dm7)     G7
Send a text as we're touching down
Em7                 A7
  But she's already circlin' round on the ground

Waiting
              Dm7      G  (F#7b5)
She's waiting just for me

  She keeps me cool when I get stressed
