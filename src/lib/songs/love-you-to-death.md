[Piano Intro] G#m  C#7   x2

[Verse 1]
In her place one hundred candles burning
As salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're sayin', swaying
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, get...

[Interlude] G#m  C#   x2
....yeah

[Verse 2]
G#m                                 C#
Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
G#m                        C#
 I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
      G#m                                       C#
Those lips smooth, yeah I can feel what you're sayin', prayin'
             G#m                                  C#
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

[Interlude] G#m  C#   x2
....yeah

[Verse 3]
G#m                            C#
 I beg to serve, your wish is my law
G#m                               C#
 Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
G#m                            C#
Shall I prove I mean what I'm sayin', beggin'
          G#m                                  C#
I say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...
