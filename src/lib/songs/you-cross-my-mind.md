[Verse 1]
Girl it's really good to see you come around
I know you been lost, I'm glad you got found
Cause I've been a little lost myself
 
[Verse 2]
Found an old picture of you on my phone
Got a new feeling now I won't let go
Til I can, I can tell you for myself
 
[Bridge]
Why don't you stay for a while, It's been too long since I've smiled
There's too few people I trust
I won't ask you for too much, Good conversation and such
And if I'm being honest
 
[Chorus]
From time to time, you cross my mind
Good company is hard to find
From time to time, you cross my mind
So stay with me just for the night
 
[Verse 3]
Got an old record in a beat up sleeve
That same sad song that you sang to me
Back when you couldn't say it for yourself
Look I'd be lying if I said to you
That I know exactly what I should do
But I've set my whole heart on trying
 
[Bridge]
 
[Chorus] x2
 
[Outro] x2
(You cross my mind)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(You cross my mind)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
