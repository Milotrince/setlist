[Intro] F  Gm7  F  Gm7
 
[Verse 1]
      F         Am    Bb           Am
I see trees of green,    red roses too
Gm7           F      A7             Dm
   I see them bloom,     for me and you,
      Db             Gm7        C7         F     B7-5 Bbmaj7 C7
And I think to myself,   what a wonderful world.
 
[Verse 2]
      F         Am    Bb               Am
I see skies of blue      and clouds of white,
Gm7                   F     A7                 Dm
   The bright blessed day,     the dark sacred night,
      Db              Gm7           C7        F         Gm/F   F
And I think to myself,       what a wonderful world
 
 
[Bridge]
    Gm/C               C7     F/C           F6
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
    Gm/C              C7    F/C             F6
Are also on the faces    of people goin' by
      Dm              C/E             F6         C/E
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
Dm                F#dim7   Gm7          C7
   They're really saying,  "I   love    you."   I hear
 
[Verse 3]
F          Am    Bb              Am
Babies cry,         I watch them grow
Gm7                    F     A7                 Dm
    They'll learn much more      than I'll ever know
      Db              Gm7         C7        F       Eb9  D9
And I think to myself      what a wonderful world
   D7b9   Gm7             C7b9                         F    Bb6    F
Yes     I think to myself,    what a wonderful world.                ohh yeah
