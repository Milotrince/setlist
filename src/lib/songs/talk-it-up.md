[Intro]
D7sus
G       Em7
G       Em7
 
[Verse 1]
G                  Gmaj7
Smoky walls, dusty halls, no one calls
            Em7
And all the window plants are dying (la la la la..)
G                            Gmaj7
She'd talk it up, half empty cup, half-hearted love
            Em7
Half of the time halfway through crying (ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh)
          C
She don't live here by herself
         C6
Sleeping in the bed she's made
        A
Reading books about self help
        A9
Working late on Saturdays
          Am                    Am7b5
'Less she got something at stake
 
[Verse 2]
G                            Gmaj7
For heaven's sake, keep him awake, make no mistake
              Em7
He break down daily with no warning
           G                             Gmaj7
When you're 20 years old, do as you're told, get bought and sold
                 Em7
Its coldest early in the morning
         C
And he's living on Tenth Street
        C6
Getting home right around dawn
      A
Every night of every week
              A9
He's proving everybody wrong
        Am
Any day now, it won't be long
   Am7b5
So listen when I say
 
[Chorus]
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon and
G7
Give 'em all what they came here for
C
Never been done the same before
Am7b5
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon and
G7
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
C
Captain, how can you be so sure?
Am7b5
Talking up what I came here for
 
[Instrumental]
G    G9    C    D7sus
 
[Verse 3]
         G                              Gmaj7
I've been holding my own, my rag and bone, lock up alone
           Em7
I don't forget to double check it, now, no no no noâ€¦
     G                           Gmaj7
And I learned to rely on me and I, straighten my tie
            Em7
Lace my own boots zip my own jacket
          C
Because I did the best I could
      C6
I got taken down again
          A
But I got fire in my blood
      A9
I got sugar on my skin
          Am
And I got nowhere to begin
  Am7b5
So listen and I'll say
 
[Chorus]
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon
G7
Give 'em all what they came here for
C
Never been done the same before
Am7b5
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon
G7
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
C
Captain, how can you be so sure?
Am7b5
Talking up what I came here for
 
G    G9    C    Am7b5
G    G9    C    Am7b5
 
[Bridge]
        Am7
See you get what you put in
       Am9
So you cannot get upset
               Cmaj7
If you're just dipping your foot in
            Amadd9
Because you don't wanna get wet
        Cmaj7                Am7b5
And you ain't made it big yet
 
[Chorus]
G                G9
Don't you stop it
                       C
Give 'em all what they came here for
    Am7b5
Gotta talk it up 'til your face gets sore
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon
G9
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
C
Captain, how can you be so sure?
Am7b5
Talking up what I'm doing it all for
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon
G9
Give 'em all what they came here for
C
Never been done the same before
Am7b5
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon and
G9
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
C
Captain how can you be so sure?
Am7b5
Talking up what I came here for
G                    G9
Don't you stop it now, woah
C
Never been done the same
Am7b5
Talk it up 'til your face gets sore
G
Don't you stop it now, c'mon
G9
Half a mile and we'll see the shore
C
Captain, how can you be so sure?
Am7b5
Talking up what I came here for
