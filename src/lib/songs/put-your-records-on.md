Capo 2

[Verse]
G                   A7                C                                      G
Three little birds, sat on my window; And they told me I don't need to worry
G                          A7        C                                         G
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet; Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Em    B7         G                   A7
Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
C                               B7                         Am7
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Am7
Oh, don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
G                          A7
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
C                               G
You go ahead, let your hair down
G                         A7
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
C                                 G
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Cmaj7                            Cmmaj7         G
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
G                   A7
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely, 
C                                     G
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside,  (just relax, just relax)
                           A7            C                           G
Don't you let those other boys fool you, got to love that afro hair-do.
Em    B7         G                   A7
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
C                               B7                         Am7
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Am7
Don't you think it's strange?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Am7
'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Em                                              Am7
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
                                                    A7
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Am7
Do what you want to.

[Chorus] x2
