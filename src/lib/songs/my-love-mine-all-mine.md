[Intro]
Amaj7 Dm6
 
 
[Verse 1]
Amaj7                      C#7
  Moon, a hole of light, through the big top tent up high
D                         Dm
Here before and after me, shinin' down on me
Amaj7                      C#7
  Moon, tell me if I could send up my heart to you
 D                                        Dm
So when I die, which I must do, could it shine down here with you?
 
 
[Chorus]
       Amaj7      C#7
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
D       Dm
I love, my, my, mine
Amaj7                   C#7
Nothing in the world belongs to me
    D        Dm
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
Amaj7 C#7 D Dm
 
 
[Verse 2]
Amaj7                     C#7
   My baby here on earth showed me what my heart was worth
D                                          Dm
So when it comes to be my turn, could you shine it down here for her?
 
 
[Chorus]
       Amaj7      C#7
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
D       Dm
I love, my, my, mine
Amaj7                   C#7
Nothing in the world belongs to me
    D        Dm
But my love, mine, all mi-ine
 
Amaj7                   C#7
Nothing in the world is mine for free
    D        Dm                       Amaj7
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
