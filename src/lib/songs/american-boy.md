[Verse] Amaj7  F  Dm
Just another one champion sound
Me and Estelle about to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now.
Just touched down in London town.
Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
We just sold out all the floor seats
 
 
[Chorus] Amaj7  F  Dm
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy.
 
 
[Verse] Amaj7  F  Dm
He said "Hey Sister.
It's really really nice to meet you."
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type.
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'm a like what's underneath them.
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits.
First let's see the west end.
I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy
 
[Chorus] Amaj7  F  Dm
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy
 
[Verse] Amaj7  F  Dm
Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a caf√©.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.
Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneaker's looking Fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes.
Walking that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm liking this American Boy. American Boy.
 
[Chorus] Amaj7  F  Dm
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy
Let them know a gwan blud
 
[Verse] Amaj7  F  Dm
Who Killing em in the UK.
Everybody gonna to say you K, reluctantly, because most of this press don't f**k with me.
Estelle once said to me, "Cool down, down, don't act a fool now, now."
I always act a fool oww oww.
Ain't nothing new now now.
He crazy, I know what ya thinkin.
Ribena I know what you're drinking.
Rap singer. Chain Blinger.
Holla at the next chick soon as you're blinking.
What's you're persona.
About this Americana Brama.
Am I shallow cause all my clothes designer.
Dressed smart like a London Bloke.
Before he speak his suit bespoke.
And you thought he was cute before.
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke.
And I know you're not into all that.
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that CASH.
Cause a lot wags want to hear it.
And I'm feeling like Mike at his Baddest.
The Pips at they Gladys.
And I know they love it.
So to hell with all that rubbish
 
 
[Bridge] Amaj7  F  Dm
Would you be my love, my love.
Could be mine would you be my love my love, could be mine
Could you be my love, my love.
Would you be my American Boy. American Boy
 
[Chorus] Amaj7  F  Dm
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to Chicago, San Fransisco Bay.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American Boy

We got a number one Victory Royale
Yeah, Fortnite, we 'bout to get down (get down)
Ten kills on the board right now
Just wiped out Tomato Town
My friend just got downed
I revived him, now we're heading south-bound
Now we're in the Pleasant Park streets
Look at the map, go to the marked sheet

Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
I really love to Chug Jug with you
We can be pro Fortnite gamers

He said
"Hey broski, you got some heals and a shield pot?"
"I need healing and I am only at one HP"
Hey dude, sorry, I found nothing on this safari
I checked the upstairs of that house but not the underneath yet
There's a chest that's just down there
The storm is coming fast and you need heals to prepare
I've got V-Bucks that I'll spend
More than you can content
I'm a cool pro Fortnite gamer (cool pro Fortnite-)

Can we get a win this weekend?
Take me to Loot Lake
Let's change the game mode and we can Disco Dominate
Let's hop in an ATK
Take me to the zone
I'm running kind of low on meds, I need to break some stone

Dressed in all his fancy clothes
He's got Renegade Raider and he's probably a pro
He just shot my back
I turn back and I attack
I just got a Victory Royale
A Victory Royale
