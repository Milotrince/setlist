[Intro]
Gb     Gb Ab   Eb

[Verse 1]
    Eb        Ab               F           Bb
I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
    Eb           Ab      F
And then I'll be nothing forever
    Bb        Eb
And all of my memories
    Ab         F             Bb           Eb
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
        Ab           F         Bb
With my eyes with my body with me


[Chorus]
    Gb
But me and my husband
             Ab     Eb
We are doing better

It's always been just him and me
F
Together
     Gb        Ab           A
So I bet all I have on that
         Bb
Furrowed brow
       Eb            Ab
And at least in this lifetime
Eb             Db
We're sticking together
Eb        Ab
Me and my husband
Eb             Db
We're sticking together
Gb      Gb Ab   Eb  F

[Verse 2]
    Gb       Ab    F        Bb      Eb
And I am the idiot with the painted face
       Ab      F         Bb
In the corner, taking up space
    Gb            Ab       A           Bb
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved


[Chorus]
Gb
Me and my husband
             Ab
We are doing better
Eb
It's always been just him and me
F
Together
   Gb          Ab          A
So I bet all I have on that
         Bb
Furrowed brow
       Eb            Ab
And at least in this lifetime
Eb            Db
We're sticking together
Eb           Ab
Me and my husband
Eb               Db
We're sticking together
Eb          Ab
Me and my husband
Eb            Db
We are doing better
Eb       Ab       Bb
