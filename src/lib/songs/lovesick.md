[Verse 1]
E                            G#
 Floorboards creaking in my home
         G#7           Amaj7
Deathly silence when alone
       Adim7              E
Oh, I wish that you were here right now
E                      G#
 So unlike me, somehow I
         G#7                Amaj7
Fell in love in just three nights
         Adim7              E
Those November days still haunting me


[Chorus]
N.C.     E
When the gold rays fell on your skin
       G#       G#7
And my hair got caught in the wind
     Amaj7        Adim7       E
The choir sang a melancholic hymn
       E
In the morning, you will be gone
        G#        G#7
I'll be mourning, tryin' to hold on to
    Bbm7b5    Am6
The memory of your lips
G#m7        C#9sus4 C#7b9
God, I'm so love -  sick
F#m7          B9sus4  B7b9 E
What have you done    to   me?


[Verse 2]
E                       G#
 Left me in your atmosphere
          G#7          Amaj7
Inching closer, but I fear
           Adim7                E
That I'll love so much you'll slip away
E                       G#
 Getting twisted in my head
            G#7              Amaj7
Dreams are nightmares in my bed
           Adim7              E
Since the last night that I spent with you


[Chorus]
N.C.     E
When the gold rays fell on your skin
       G#       G#7
And my hair got caught in the wind
     Amaj7        Adim7      E
The choir sang a melancholy hymn
       E
In the morning, you're not in my bed
          G#      G#7
I'll just sleep until I fall dead
    Bbm7b5    Am6
The memory of your lips
G#m7        C#9sus4 C#7b9
God, I'm so love -  sick
F#m7          B9sus4  B7b9 E
What have you done    to   me?
