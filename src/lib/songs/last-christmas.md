[Intro] D Bm Em A

[Chorus]
D                                           Bm
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away
Em                                    A
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Chorus]
[Interlude] D Bm Em A

[Verse 1]
D                           Bm                                        [ Em ]
 Once bitten and twice shy,  I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Em                                A
 Tell me baby do you recognize me? Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
D
 "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it 
Bm
With a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it
Em
Now I know what a fool I've been 
           A
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
[Interlude] D Bm Em A

[Verse 3]
D                                      Bm
 Crowded room, friends with tired eyes  Hiding from you and your soul of ice
Em
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on 
A
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
  D
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
  Bm                                    [ Em ]
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Em                                      A
 Maybe this year, Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

[Chorus] x2
