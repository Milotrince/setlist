Live a simple life in a quiet town

Steady as she goes
Steady as she goes
               (single)  Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes

Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife

Steady as she goes
So steady as she goes

                 G
Well here we go again
                     A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
                        G
But no matter what you do
                  A
You'll always feel as though you
             E
Tripped and fell

[Chorus]
            (single) Bm   F#   A   E   x2
So steady as she goes

[Verse]
                           Bm           F#           A    E
When you have completed what you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue
                      Bm   F#   A   E
Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

G|-7~--7~--6~--9~--|

[Chorus]
                  Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
So steady as she goes
                   G
Well here we go again
                     A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
                       G
But no matter what you do
                  A                           E
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell
                     Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes


[Verse]
                  Bm          F#       A       E
Settle for a world, neither up or down
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round
Settle for a girl, neither up or down
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round

G|-7~--7~--6~--4~--|   x2

[Chorus]
                    Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes
Steady as she goes
So steady as she goes
                Bm           F#          A        E
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
                Bm
Steady as she goes
