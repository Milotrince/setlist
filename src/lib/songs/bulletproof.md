Capo 4
[Intro] Bm E G Bm x2

[Verse]
Bm							    E
Been there, done that, messed around; I’m having fun don’t put me down
     G                             Bm
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet
                              E
I won’t let you in again; The messages I’ve tried to send
   G                            Bm
My informations’ just not going in
                                     E
Burnin’ bridges shore to shore; I’ll break away from something more
    G                                Bm
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Bm							    E
Been there, done that, messed around; I’m having fun don’t put me down
     G                             Bm
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
D                Em       G     D
This time maybe, I’ll be, bulletproof
D                Em       G     D         Bm E G Bm
This time maybe, I’ll be, bulletproof

[Verse]
Bm                               E
I won’t let you turn around; And tell me now I’m much too proud
   G                                  Bm
To walk away from something when it’s dead
                                E
Do do do your dirty worst; Come out to play when you are hurt
        G                                    Bm
There’s certain things that should be left unsaid
                                      E
tick tick tick tick on the watch; And life’s too short for me to stop
   G                          Bm
Oh baby, your time is running out
Bm                               E
I won’t let you turn around; And tell me now I’m much too proud
G                             Bm
All you do is fill me up with doubt

[Chorus] x2 (second time maybe -> baby)
[Outro]
A    Bm   D    E  G     Bm
This time I'll be bulletproof  x2
