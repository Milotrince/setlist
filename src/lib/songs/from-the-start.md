[Intro]
 
Ebm9 Ab13 Dbmaj7
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
          Ebm9    Ab13
Don't you notice how
Dbmaj7                          Ebm9    Ab13
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Dbmaj7
Me and you and awkward silence
Ebm9       Ab13         Fm7     Bb7#5
Don't you dare look at me that way
Ebm9                           Ab13
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        Ebm9     Ab13
Oh, the burning pain
Dbmaj7                              Ebm9     Ab13
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
Dbmaj7
"She's so perfect", blah, blah, blah
    Ebm9   Ab13             Fm7    Bb7#5
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Ebm9                              Ab13
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     Ebm9    Ab13
That when I talk to you
    Dbmaj7
Oh, Cupid walks right through
    Ebm9        Ab13            Dbmaj7
And shoots an arrow through my heart
    Ebm9     Ab13
And I sound like a loon
    Fm7       Bb7#5
But don't you feel it too?
    Ebm9   Ab13               Dbmaj7
Confess I loved you from the start
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
Ebm9 Ab13
 
         Dbmaj7
Bi-ya-ba-da
            Ebm9    Ab13   Dbmaj7
Ba-ba-da-ba-da, da-da, da-da
      Ebm9       Ab13
Bi-ya-da, ya-ba-da
   Fm7                 Bb7#5
Ba-bi, ya-da-ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-di
      Ebm9           Ab13
Ya-ba-bi, ya-da, da-da
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
         Ebm9     Ab13
What's a girl to do
  Dbmaj7                   Ebm9    Ab13
Lying on my bed, staring into the bluе?
Dbmaj7
Unrequited, terrifying
Ebm9     Ab13         Fm7   Bb7#5
Lovе is driving me a bit insane
Ebm9                                Ab13
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     Ebm9    Ab13
That when I talk to you
    Dbmaj7
Oh, Cupid walks right through
    Ebm9        Ab13            Dbmaj7
And shoots an arrow through my heart
    Ebm9     Ab13
And I sound like a loon
    Fm7       Bb7#5
But don't you feel it too?
    Ebm9   Ab13               Dbmaj7
Confess I loved you from the start
 
 
[Outro]
 
   Ebm9    Ab13
Confess I loved you
     Fm7      Bb7#5
Just thinking of you
  Ebm9       Ab13               Dbmaj7
I know I've loved you from the start
