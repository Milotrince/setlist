[Intro] A B G#m E  F#m G#m Am (harm B A)

[Verse 1]
A  B  A       B              G#m
In my dreams, underneath the stars
    E             A            B          G#m
Are letters in my heart saying maybe it's true
     E     A         Am           G#m           Gm        F#m      G#m Am
That baby, you  will turn to baby blue, falling just like oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

[Verse 2]
        A     B              C#m
Take it slow, feel it in our bones
    E                A         B             G#m
And by the end we'll know that we were never dreaming
E       A         Am               G#m                Gm   F#m    G#m Am  B
In good time  the white inside our eyes, will turn to baby blu-u-u-u-ue

[Chorus]
A         B      G#m       E    
Lalala la la-la, lalala la-la  x2
A                    Am         G#m              Gm
With nothing more to say, these words will never change
    F#m      A    B        A
For you, for you, I will stay

[Interlude] A B G#m E  A B G#m E  A Am G#m Gm  F#m A 

[Verse 3]
A     B   A    B                  G#m
Can't you see? you're the one who sees
E            A        B          G#m
Me for who I am, will you be the answer?
E        A     Am                 G#m           Gm        F#m      G#m Am
All this time, trying to make you mine, falling just like oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

[Chorus] [Interlude] [Chorus]

[Chorus]
A         B      G#m       E    
Lalala la la-la, lalala la-la  x2
A              Am    G#m                  Gm
Feeling all at ease, now that you're with me
    F#m        A    B       A
With you, with you, I will stay

[Outro] A B G#m E  A B Am
