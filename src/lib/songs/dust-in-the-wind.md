[Verse 1]
  C     G/B  Am    G         Dm            Am
I close my eyes only for a moment and a moment's gone.
C   G/B   Am     G             Dm          Am
All my dreams pass before my eyes a curiosity.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

[Verse 2]
C  G/B  Am    G             Dm              Am
Same old song, just a drop of water in the endless sea.
C   G/B  Am   G                 Dm                Am
All we do, crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

[Verse 3]
C      G/B   Am   G                Dm             Am
Don't hang on, nothing last's forever but the earth and sky.
C  G5      Am  G                  Dm         Am
It slips away all your money won't another minute buy.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.
