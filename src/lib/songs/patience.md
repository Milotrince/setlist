[Intro]
C G A D    C G A D
C G C Em   C G D D

[Verse 1]
C                                     G
  Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you,  I'm still alright to smile
A                              D      Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
  Girl I think about you every day now
C                                        G
  Was a time when I wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease
A                                  D       Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
  There is no doubt, you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
C             G                   C                Em
  Said woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine
C              G              D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
All we need is just a little patience
C             G                      C              Em
  Said sugar, make it slow and it'll come together fine
C              G              D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
All we need is just a little patience
D  Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D   x3

[Verse 2]
C                                    G
  I sit here on the stairs, cause I'd rather be alone
   A                                D        Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
C                                 G
  Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
    A                                           D   Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
But you know love, there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
C             G                 C                   Em
  Said woman, take it slow, and things will be just fine
C                 G             D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
You and I'll just use a little patience
C             G                       C                   Em
  Said sugar, take the time cause the lights are shining bright
C                G                 D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
You and I've got what it takes to make it
   D            Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D
We won't fake it
 Dsus2 D                  Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D
Ahh,   I'll never break it
Dsus2    D            Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
 Cause I can't take it

Just a little patience, yeah

[Outro]
D
  I've been walking the streets tonight
G
  Just trying to get it right
D
  It's hard to see with so many around
    G
You know I donâ€™t like being stuck in the crowd
        D
And the streets don't change but baby the names
G
  I ain't got time for the game
         D
Cause I need you
                  G
Yeah yeah, well I need you
         F
Ooooh, I need you
       G
Woh, I need you
            D     G    D
Ooooh, this time
