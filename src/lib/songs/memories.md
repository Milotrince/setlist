Capo 4
[Chorus]
G                  D            Em                 Bm
Here's to the ones that we got, Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
           C                 G                    C                D
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories, of everything we've been through
G             D           Em                Bm
Toast to ones here today, Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
           C                 G
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        C              D                    N.C.
And the memories bring back memories, bring back you

[Verse 1]
          G             D              Em              Bm
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
       C              G              C                    D
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
       G                 D                Em            Bm
Now my heart feel like December, when somebody say your name
         C                  G               C               D
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, ayy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
G      D                     Em              Bm
  Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
C          G                      C                    D
  But everything gon' be alright, go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
[Refrain] D Em Bm C G (Doo doo..)
C              D                    N.C.
Memories bring back memories, bring back you

[Verse 2]
          G             D              Em            Bm
There's a time that I remember, when I never felt so lost
       C               G               C            D
