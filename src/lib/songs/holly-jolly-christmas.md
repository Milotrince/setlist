[Verse 1]
       C                                                 G7
Have a holly, jolly Christmas, it's the best time of the year,
                                                    C     G7
I don't know if there'll be snow, but have a cup of cheer.

[Verse 2]
       C                                                  G7
Have a holly, jolly Christmas, and when you walk down the street,
                                               C
Say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet.

[Bridge]
F            Em         F                  C
Hey, ho, the mistletoe, hung where you can see,
Dm         Am             D7       Am   D7  G
Somebody's waiting there, kiss her once for me.

[Verse 3]
       C                                             G7
Have a holly, jolly Christmas and in case you didn't hear,
                     C            D7        G7   C
Oh, by golly, have a holly, jolly Christmas this year.
