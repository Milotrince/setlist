[Intro] A
 
[Verse 1]
                A                                      F#m
I built a friend with three pieces of plastic and a pen,
                                  D
I made him on the table in the den,
                                      A           E
I gave him my old cellphone for a head,  for a head.
       A                                   F#m
And we spent holidays in my house, and we left presents in the stocking,
          D                                               A                   E
And we bought bolts and things and strings and a new watch, that's what he got.
 
[Chorus]
D                                A               E
And we had so much fun together, we knew we'd be friends forever.
And we had so much fun together, we had so much fun.
 
[Verse 2]
        A                                     F#m
Then I left for college in September, and we wept cause we can't be together
      D                                      A           E
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend,  my old friend
        A                                   F#m
Then I met this girl at graduation, and forget my oldest creation
       D                                        A               E
And I guess I'll see him next vacation; send my best, I send my best
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3]
          A                                  F#m
I came home to find him on the table with a note
                                 D
Scribbled out in pencil and he wrote
                                  A          E
That he just wasn't stable all alone,  all alone.
          A                                       F#m
Next to him, an empty glass of water that he spilled
                          D
All over the body that I built,
                                      A                   E
It fizzled and it popped and then it killed,  and then it killed.
 
[Chorus]

[Outro]
           A
I built a friend.
