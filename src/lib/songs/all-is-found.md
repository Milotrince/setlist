[Intro]
Am

[Verse 1]
               Am                D
Where the north wind meets the sea
               F             C
There's a river full of memory
          Dm                   F
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
C        G                  Am
For in this river all is found

[Verse 2]
       Am             D
In her waters, deep and true
        F             C
Lie the answers and a path for you
           Dm               F
Dive down deep into her sound
 C        G                       Am
But not too far or you'll be drowned

[Verse 3]
        F                            C
Yes, she will sing to those who'll hear
              Dm              Bb
And in her song, all magic flows
       F                            Em
But can you brave what you most fear?
         Dm                      Fm
Can you face what the river knows?

[Verse 4] (Capo 1)
          Am                   D
Where the north wind meets the sea
          F              C
There's a mother full of memory
         Dm               F
Come, my darling, homeward bound
            G                   Am
When all is lost, then all is found

[Outro]
Am
