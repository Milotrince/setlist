[Verse 1]
Am7                         Am7             Gmaj7   Em7
Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
    Am7                 Am7           Gmaj7   Em7
And how much can I be expected to tolerate?
     Am7                        D7
So I started to think about the plans I made
    Gmaj7  Em7
The debt unpaid
    Am7
And you just can't call
D7          Gmaj7
  A spade a spade
 
[Chorus]
Cmaj7  D6         Em7
I     watch the moon
              Cmaj7
Let it run  my mood
D6                  Em7
Can’t stop thinking of you
Cmaj7  D6    Em7
I      watch you
Cmaj7           D6
So long nice to know you I'll be
Bm7    Cmaj7*
Moving on
 
[Verse 2]
Am7
We started off in such a nice place
Gmaj7           Em7
We were talking the same language
Am7
I o-open and I'm closing
Gmaj7               Em7
You can’t stand the thought
                  Am7
of a real beating heart
         Bm11            Gmaj7/A
You'd be holding, having trouble
    Em7          Am7
O-o-owning and admit that
     Bm11*
I am hoping
 
[Chorus]
Cmaj7  D6         Em7
I      watch the moon
              Cmaj7
Let it run  my mood
D6                  Em7
Can’t stop thinking of you
Cmaj7  D6    Em7
I      watch you
Cmaj7           D6
So long nice to know you I'll be
Bm7    Cmaj7*
Moving on
Bm7    Cmaj7*
Moving on

[Bridge]
Am7
You
                       Em7
Yeah I always know the truth
                       Am7
But I can't just say it to you
                Gmaj7
Yeah I know the truth
  Am7
I knew
                       Em7
Yeah I always know the truth
                       Am7
But I can't just say it to you
                Gmaj7
Yeah I know the truth
Am7
  I never thought we'd see it through
Em7
  I never could rely on you
Am7                  Gmaj7
  And few times your face came
     Am7
Into view
     Em7
Into view
             Am7
I'm not into you
     Gmaj7
Into you
