[Verse 1]
                G     Gsus4 G                   Asus2        Am
Starry, starry  night,       paint your palette blue and grey
              C          Cmaj7   D7                                G
Look out on a summer's day, with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
                   G Gsus4 G                    Asus2    Am
Shadows on the hills,       Sketch the trees and daffodils
                 C          Cmaj7      D7                        G
Catch the breeze and winter chills, in colors on the snowy linen land

[Chorus]
                Am  D7                  G   G/F#  Em
And now I understand  what you tried to say to me,
                         Am      D7                         Em
How you suffered for your sanity, how you tried to set them free,
                                    A7       Am   D7                 G
They would not listen, they did not know how,  perhaps they'll listen now

[Verse 2]
                G     Gsus4 G                Asus2         Am
Starry, starry  night,       flaming flowers that brightly blaze,
                   C      Cmaj7   D7                              G
Swirling clouds in violet haze reflecting Vincent's eyes of china blue
                G  Gsus4 G                   Asus2    Am
Colors changing hue,       Morning fields of amber grain
                C        Cmaj7    D7                                  G
Weathered faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

[Chorus]
                Am   D7                 G      G/F# Em
And now I understand  what you tried to say to me,
                          Am     D7                          Em
How you suffered for your sanity,  how you tried to set them free,
                                    A7       Am    D7                 G
They would not listen, they did not know how,  perhaps they'll listen now

[Bridge]
                   Am       D7                        G    G/F# Em
For they could not love you,  but still your love was true
            Am                             Cm
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry, starry night,
    G                 F            E7
You took your life as lovers often do
      Am                                 C
But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was
                       D7           G
Never meant for one as beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
                G     Gsus4 G                  Asus2     Am
Starry, starry  night,       portraits hung in empty halls,
                   C        Cmaj7      D7                                     G
Frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
                               G  Gsus4 G                   Asus2       Am
Like the strangers that you've met        The ragged men in ragged clothes
                    C                D7                               G
The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

[Chorus]
                  Am   D7                 G   G/F# Em
And now I think I know  what you tried to say to me,
                          Am     D7                          Em
How you suffered for your sanity,  how you tried to set them free,
                                   A7              Am  D7              G
They would not listen, they're not listening still, perhaps they never will
