Capo 1

[Verse 1]
C                  G      C     G
No New Year's day, to celebrate, 
             C                             DmM7
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away. 
            Dm      DmM7       Dm DmM7
No first of spring, no song to sing, 
         Dm                  G        C
In fact, here's just another ordinary day. 
C                 G       C    G
No April rain, no flowers bloom, 
           C                            Dm  DmM7
no wedding Saturday within the month of June. 
            Dm  DmM7         Dm  DmM7
But what it is, is something true, 
           Dm                     G             C
made up of these three words that I must say to you. 

[Chorus]
       Dm        G     C
I just called to say I love you, 
       F         G              Am
I just called to say how much I care. 
       Dm        G     C
I just called to say I love you, 
      F                G            C
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. 

[Verse 2]
            C     G       C  G
No summer's high, no warm July, 
           C                               Dm  DmM7
no harvest moon to light one tender August night. 
          Dm      DmM7       Dm    DmM7
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves, 
         Dm                G               C
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. 
         C    G        C  G
No Libra Sun, no Halloween, 
          C                                   Dm   DmM7
no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. 
            Dm  DmM7           Dm  DmM7
But what it is, though old, so new. 
             Dm                  G                C
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do.
