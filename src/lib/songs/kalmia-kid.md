[Intro] G Gmaj7 E7 A D D7

[Verse 1]
G              Gmaj7             E7
If I found someone to stick like glue to
             A
I'd probably peer out from the leaves
              D           D7
Hide a couple roses up my sleeve
      G             Gmaj7              E7
And I always find myself stuck in this love goo
             A
Feelings are hard to ignore
                    D                       D7
Especially when you don't know what they're for

[Pre-Chorus]
      C
Don't know just what makes flowers bloom
      D                   D7
But I hope that they'll enjoy a tune

[Chorus]
   G           B7                    Em
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me
    G            B7              Em
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me

[Verse 2]
     G             Gmaj7         E7
It's lonely in the forest that I grow in
               A
I wish I could dive into the sea
                       D               D7
But I'm stuck inside a hive covered in honey
  G            Gmaj7              E7
I never really know which way I'm goin'
                          A
But I guess the weather's warm enough to bear
                    D              D7
And I never have to brush or do my hair



[Pre-Chorus]
      C
Don't know just what makes flowers bloom
      D                   D7
But I hope that they'll enjoy a tune

[Chorus]
   G           B7                    Em
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me
    G            B7              Em
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me

[Bridge]
     G             Gmaj7        E7
It's lonely in the coral reef I float in
               A
I wish I could swim out of the sea
                   D                 D7
But sharks are circling and nothin's easy
  G                  Gmaj7              E7
I still don't really know which way I'm goin'
                        A
But I guess the water's warm enough to bear
                       D              D7
And I'll never have to wash or dry my hair

[Pre-Chorus]
  C
I miss watching the flowers bloom
       D                D7
But at least I can keep writing tunes

[Chorus]
   G           B7                    Em
So if the only love I'll feel is for bumblebees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me
    G            B7              Em
And if I'll only ever dance with pine trees
Em               A                       D   D7
That's fine with me,    That's fine with me
