[Verse]
A#m7          D#m7
  Times are hard
        G#                C#maj7
You're afraid to pay the fee
       F#                B
So you find yourself somebody
        C#             G#/C A#m7 G#
Who can do the job for free
F#maj7   A#m7           D#m7
When you need a bit of lovin'
           G#            C#maj7
Cause your man is out of town
           F#              B
That's the time you get me runnin'
        C#            D#m
And you know I'll be around

[Chorus]
C#     F#maj7          A#m7
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
   B
Oh yeah

 I don't wanna do your dirty work

[Verse]
A#m7        D#m7
 Light the candle
        G#            C#maj7
Put the lock upon the door
         F#                 B
You have sent the maid home early
       C#             G#/C A#m7 G#
Like a thousand times before
F#maj7    A#m7           D#m7
Like the castle in its corner
     G#       C#maj7
In a medieval game
      F#           B
I foresee terrible trouble
      C#                 D#m
And I stay here just the same

[Chorus]
C#     F#maj7          A#m7
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
   B
Oh yeah
C#       F#maj7        A#m7
 I don't wanna do your dirty work
   B
No more
C#     F#              A#m7
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work
   B        C#  F#
Oh yeah
