[Intro] F Am Cm D7 Gm C7

[Verse 1]
F                             Am
I'm comin' home, I've done my time.
         Cm               D7           Gm
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine.
                   Bbm             Dm
If you received my letter, tellin' you I'd soon be free,
G7                                Bbm6              C7  Bbm6              C7
then you'll know just what to do, if you still want me; if you still want me

[Chorus]
F                              Am
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old Oak tree,
          Cm                       D7         Gm
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
                 Bbm              F   A7  Dm
If I don't see a ribbon round the old oak tree,
     F                   F+            Dm               D7
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
   Gm            Bbm           Gm7       C7      F 
If I don't see a yellow ribbon round the old Oak tree.

[Verse 2]
F                            Am
Bus driver, please, look for me.
        Cm               D7               Gm
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see.
                    Bbm            Dm
I'm really still in prison, and my love she holds the key.
  G7                            Bbm6           C7    Bbm6                 C7
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free; I wrote and told her please

[Chorus]
[Instrumental] F Am Cm D7 Gm C7; F Am Cm D7 Gm

[Bridge]
F       Gm                Bbm
Now the whole damn bus is cheering,
      F               D7
and I can't believe I see..
  Gm             Bbm               Gm7 C7  F
A hundred yellow ribbons round the old Oak tree!
           Am   Cm D7 Gm C7
I'm comin' home...

[Outro] F; Am; Cm; D7 Gm C7
