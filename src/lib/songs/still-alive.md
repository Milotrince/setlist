D       Bm
This was a tri-umph
D       Bm       D          Bm       D     Bm
    I'm making a note here: huge suc-cess
     Em           A              D        Bm     D
It's hard to over-state my satis-faction
Bm           D     Bm
Aperture Sci-ence
D      Bm         D       Bm       D     Bm
    We do what we must be-cause we can
Em              A                      Bb
For the good of all of us, ex-cept the ones who are dead
 
            F        C           Bb        F
But there's no sense crying over every mis-take
         F       C               Bb         F
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
        Gm           C            F           Dm
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
        Bb         A           D     Bm
For the people who are still a-live
 
D     Bm     D     Bm
 
D       Bm       D       Bm
    I'm not even angry
D       Bm        D      Bm         D     Bm
        I'm being so sin-cere right now
Em              A                  D          Bm     D
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
    Bm             D     Bm
And tore me to pie-ces
D       Bm          D        Bm   D     Bm
    And threw every piece in-to a fire
Em                A                     Bb
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
 
          F         C           Bb        F
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
          F      C              Bb         F
And we're out of beta, we're re-leasing on time
       Gm         C                F                 Dm
So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
        Bb         A           D     Bm
For the people who are still a-live
 
D     Bm     D     Bm
 
D   Bm           D        Bm
    Go ahead and leave me
D     Bm            D      Bm      D      Bm
    I think I'd pre-fer to stay in-side
Em                A               D         Bm     D
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Bm          D      Bm
Maybe Black Me-sa
D   Bm         D        Bm      D       Bm
    That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance
Em          A                          Bb
Anyway this cake is great, It's so del-icious and moist
 
        F        C                    Bb         F
Look at me still talking when there's science to do
       F        C                 Bb           F
When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you
        Gm           C             F              Dm
I've ex-periments to run, there is research to be done
       Bb         A           D      Bm
On the people who are still a-live
 
       D          Bm         D     Bm
And be-lieve me I am still a-live
          D           Bm          D     Bm
I'm doing science and I'm still a-live
           D          Bm          D     Bm
I feel fan-tastic and I'm still a-live
             D          Bm         D     Bm
While you're dying I'll be still a-live
                D           Bm         D     Bm
And when you're dead I will be still a-live
 
D      Bm
 
      A
Still   live
      A
Still   live
