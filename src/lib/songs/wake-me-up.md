[Intro]
Bm   G   D   A
Bm   G   D   A F#
 
[Verse 1]
Bm       G              D         A
Feeling my way through the darkness
Bm       G          D         A
Guided by a beating heart
Bm       G              D         A
I can't tell where the journey will end
Bm       G          D         A
But I know where it starts
Bm       G              D         A
They tell me I'm too young to understand,
Bm       G          D         A
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Bm       G              D         A
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Bm       G          D         A
Well that's fine by me
 
[Chorus]
            Bm      G       D     A
So wake me up when it's all over
          Bm    G     D        A
When I'm wiser and I'm older
        Bm         G           D       A
All this time I was finding myself, And I
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
 
            Bm      G       D     A
So wake me up when it's all over
          Bm    G     D        A
When I'm wiser and I'm older
        Bm         G           D       A
All this time I was finding myself, And I
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
 
[Verse 2]
Bm       G              D         A
I tried carrying the weight of the world
Bm       G          D         A
But I only have two hands
Bm       G              D         A
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
Bm       G          D         A
But I don't have any plans
Bm       G              D         A
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Bm       G          D         A
Not afraid to close my eyes
Bm       G              D         A
Life's a game made for everyone
Bm       G          D         A
And love is the prize
 
[Chorus]
            Bm      G       D     A
So wake me up when it's all over
          Bm    G     D        A
When I'm wiser and I'm older
        Bm         G           D       A
All this time I was finding myself, And I
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
 
            Bm      G       D     A
So wake me up when it's all over
          Bm    G     D        A
When I'm wiser and I'm older
        Bm         G           D       A
All this time I was finding myself, And I
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
 
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
Bm      G     D      A
didn't know I was lost
