Capo 3

[Verse 1]
    D                   A           A7                   D
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  G                           D                    A       A7      D
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better
    D               A               A7                 D
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, you were made to go out and get her 
    G                             D                A      A7      D
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better

[Chorus]
D7                       G         Bm      Em
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
      G         A7              D
don’t carry the world upon your shoulders
D7                            G        Bm       Em
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
   G          A7             D
by making his world a little colder

[Interlude] D  D7  A7, Da da da da da da da da

[Verse 2]
    D                  A              A7                    D
Hey Jude, don’t let me down, you have found her, now go and get her
  G                           D                   A        A7      D
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better

[Chorus]
D7                       G       Bm      Em
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
       G           A7            D
you're waiting for someone to perform with
D7                                G        Bm           Em
And don’t you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
    G            A7              D
the movement you need is on your shoulders

[Interlude] D  D7  A7
[Verse 3]
    D                   A           A7                   D
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  G                            D                A      A7      D
Remember to let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better

D         C          G                D
