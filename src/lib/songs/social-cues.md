A Bm

[Verse 1]
Em                    D
  I think it's strange  when people say
Em                          D               A
  You're the next big thing,  you'll never fade
Em                    D
  The slightest touch,  forced to fold
A                     Bm
  Sleight of the hand,  modern gold

[Pre-chorus]
Em             D         Em
  Starry-eyed child left behind
D            A        Em
Choose your favorite vice
D                                  A     Bm
I don't have the strength to play nice

[Chorus]
G5              Em        A                 F#m
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
       Bm                      A
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
G5             Em         A                 F#m
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
      Bm                      A
Don't know if I can play this part much longer
G5  Em      A       F#m   Bm       A
I-I-I don't know if it is right to live this way, yeah
G5             Em         A                 F#m
I'll be in the back room, tell me when it's over
Bm
People always say, "Man, at least you're on the radio”

[Interlude]
Em       D
     At least you’re on the radio
Em       D                  A
     At least you’re on the radio
Em       D                         A   Bm
     At least you’re on the radio

[Verse 2]
Em                D
  Close your eyes,  don't be afraid
Em                   D        A
  Take some of these,  they'll ease the pain
Em                     D
  Live fast, die young,  pay the price
A                  Bm
The best die young,  immortalized


[Pre-chorus]
Em             D              Em
   Starry-eyed children left behind
    D            A       Em
To choose their favorite vice
D                                  A      Bm
I don't have the strength to think twice

[Chorus]
G5              Em        A                 F#m
Hide me in the back room, tell me when it's over
